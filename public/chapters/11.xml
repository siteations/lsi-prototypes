                <p>The unease and anomie that people experience when familiar social structures have
                    collapsed created a conservative reaction to machine-age modernity: Historicism,
                    a mentality that values particular cultures and vanished epochs. Giambattista
                    Vico (<date when="1668">1668</date>&#x2014; <date when="1744">1744</date>) was a
                    progenitor of the idea that there is no universal, timeless human culture, that
                    remote cultures are entirely different from current ones, and that it is the
                    task of the historian to reconstruct a view of other times and other places with
                    deep, sympathetic imagination. <name type="pname">Johann Gottfried von
                        Herder</name> (<date when="1744">1744</date>&#x2013;<date when="1803"
                        >1803</date>) propounded this thesis, which became one of the several
                    strands of Romantic thought. His views helped establish a deeper and more
                    discriminating appreciation of the particular artistic expressions of various
                    cultures, both ones that were remote in time and place and others nearer at
                    hand. The search for roots, for history, so prevalent today even as the entire
                    world streams toward globalization, the latest and most advanced form of
                    cosmopolitanism, is symptomatic of the continuing hold Herder's Romantic thesis
                    has upon our minds.</p>
                <p><name type="pname">John Ruskin</name> (<date when="1819">1819</date>&#x2013;<date
                        when="1900">1900</date>) was the principal contemporary spokesman for the
                    viewpoint that denied the beneficence of Victorian industrial progress as it was
                    reaching its apogee in late nineteenth-century <name type="place"
                    >England</name>. As the precursor of the Arts and Crafts movement, Ruskin
                    articulated its fundamental principles in <hi rend="italic">The Seven Lamps of
                        Architecture</hi> (<date when="1848">1848</date>). These included
                    architecture for the sake of beauty rather than mere function, honesty of
                    materials, power of impression, inspiration from nature, virile liveliness,
                    commemorative quality, and accordance with universally accepted styles. Ruskin
                    found in medieval styles and their several period and regional inflections an
                    architecture that accorded with these concepts. His influence was strong and
                    long-lasting, helping to account for the naturalistic exuberance of
                    nineteenth-century architectural ornament and the extensive use of animal and
                    vegetable forms in the decorative arts.</p>
                <p>Leaders of the Arts and Crafts movement expressed a similar reaction to machine
                    technology. Perhaps the most articulate and angry among them was the English
                    poet, designer, and socialist lecturer William Morris (<date when="1834"
                        >1834</date>&#x2014;<date when="1896">1896</date>), who wrote extensively on
                    the problems associated with industrialization, gave practical application to
                    Ruskin's philosophy, and was closely allied with the group of painters who
                    called themselves the Pre-Raphaelites. Like Ruskin, Morris was a strong
                    proponent of medievalism because of the artisan traditions represented by the
                    craft guilds in the Middle Ages. In <date when="1861">1861</date>, he opened a
                    firm, Morris, Marshall, Faulkner &amp; Company&#x2014;"Fine Art Workmen in
                    Painting, Carving, Furniture and the Metals"&#x2014;for the production of
                    handcrafted home furnishings. For Morris, an imaginary sojourn in the Middle
                    Ages provided a mental escape from the fast-changing landscape of the nineteenth
                    century. His own highly organic but stylized designs for wallpaper and furniture
                    ornament are akin to medieval patterns. In <date when="1877"
                    >1877</date>&#x2014;several years before he published <hi rend="italic">News
                        from Nowhere</hi> (<date when="1891">1891</date>), his utopian guide to the
                    future&#x2014;Morris founded the Society for the Protection of Ancient
                    Buildings, which focused on the simple beauty of vernacular architecture.
                    Historic preservation remained an important component of the Arts and Crafts
                    movement.</p>
                <p>The Viennese architect and city planner Camillo Sitte was perhaps the most
                    influential opponent of the international urban planning movement that was
                    gathering momentum in the wake of Haussmann's transformation of <name
                        type="place">Paris</name>. Sitte saw emulation of the medieval town square
                    as a place-fixing remedy for the spatially diffuse modern city with its new
                    wide, straight thoroughfares designed for rapid vehicular movement. Arts and
                    Crafts aesthetics, later mingled with a painterly approach borrowed from the
                    Impressionists, had an important influence on architecture in the second half of
                    the nineteenth century, especially in Great Britain. Its Picturesque principles
                    of design called for a<pb n="376"/><pb n="376" type="orig"/>continuation of
                    handcrafted ornamentation of buildings, and this ran counter to the machine-age
                    trend toward a faceless, abstract architecture based on the use of such new
                    building materials as cast iron and glass.</p>
                <p>Inevitably, Ruskin's towering influence was felt in the garden as well. Paxton's
                    Crystal Palace in <name type="place">London</name>, which had so impressed the
                    public in <date when="1851">1851</date>, conspicuously symbolized not only the
                    Industrial Age architecture that Ruskin despised but also the Victorian
                    enthusiasm for showy hybridized plants made possible by glasshouse horticulture.
                    The Arts and Crafts movement that the followers of Ruskin and Morris carried
                    forward numbered among its ranks several landscape professionals who saw the
                    carpet-bedding practices of contemporary gardeners as vulgar rote exercises.
                    William Robinson and Gertrude Jekyll were the foremost apostles of a new form of
                    planting, which substituted a more casual and painterly approach employing
                    naturalized shrubs, wildflowers, and perennials for the Victorian gardener's
                    formulaic flower beds. In fractious opposition to Robinson's advocacy of a
                    naturalistic, picturesque style of gardening, the architect Reginald Blomfield
                    set forth an approach oriented more toward architecture than painterly
                    composition, which Blomfield labeled "formal."</p>
                <p>The Edwardian Age now appears as the halcyon twilight of aristocratic
                    pleasures&#x2014;garden parties, croquet games, lawn tennis&#x2014;in verdant
                    settings beautifully maintained by large staffs of gardeners. In the
                    pre-income-tax United States, industrial wealth generated fortunes that
                    Beaux-Arts-trained designers displayed in Italianate gardens of the Country
                    Place Era. The gardens commissioned by latter-day British aristocrats and
                    wealthy Americans for their country estates or the venerable European
                    ch&#x00E2;teaux and villas they and others restored were highly eclectic.
                    Overall, they displayed their owners' and designers' appreciation of historic
                    gardens, reintroduction of intimate scale and spatial enclosure, use of topiary
                    and other "old-fashioned" forms, and loose, naturalistic planting composition in
                    which color plays an important role. Whether derived from Arts and Crafts
                    principles, Italianate and Beaux-Arts formality, or a combination of the
                    naturalistic and the formal, the principal design premise of the Edwardian
                    garden was one of sheer aestheticism; it was an expression of art for art's
                    sake. As such, it represented no ideological set of values and existed only in
                    the context of <hi rend="italic">style.</hi> It was, like the current obsession
                    with expressing history in the landscape, a consumer's option in which period
                    style became itself a dominant cultural value. No longer bound to
                    representation&#x2014;the re-presentation of ideas and beliefs through
                    art&#x2014;design had become a matter of mere choice involving selection among
                    several available historical styles. As such, it no longer expressed the
                    philosophical or literary values of its own age, being instead a graceful echo
                    of forms whose original meaning was now lost.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>Thus, by the end of the nineteenth century, the result of Herder's Romantic
                    thesis a century earlier, with its emphasis on historical appreciation as a
                    source of heightened meaning in contemporary life, was firmly rooted. Whether
                    accomplished by talented amateurs or by the emerging professionals who called
                    themselves landscape architects, garden design had become almost entirely
                    self-referential. Landscape designs bore no messages other than those of a
                    sentimental nature &#x2014; remembrances of flowers in Shakespeare's plays;
                    charming evocations of "bygoneness," as in "Queen Anne" period gardens; or
                    images evoking Kate Greenaway's illustrations for children's books (fig.
                    11.1).</p>
                <p>Because of its association with domesticity, the landscape design field was open
                    earlier than others to women practitioners. In the estate gardens she designed,
                    Beatrix Jones Farrand, one of the founders of the American Society of Landscape
                    Architects, drew upon the Arts and Crafts legacy of Jekyll; the work of Thomas
                    Mawson, who combined Arts and Crafts garden style with Beaux-Arts planning
                    principles; and a traveler's first-hand acquaintance with Italian villa gardens.
                    Farrand's contemporary, Ellen Biddle Shipman, who had less opportunity to
                    journey abroad and study examples of European landscape design, created original
                    gardens that complemented the American Colonial Revival architecture then
                    fashionable. In <name type="place">California</name> and <name type="place"
                        >Florida</name>, landscape designers were especially eclectic, borrowing
                    inspiration from Italian villas and harking to distant echoes of Islamic Spain
                    as they sought to forge regional idioms based upon the sunny Mediterranean-type
                    climate and Hispanic heritage found in these states. In both, a vegetal palette
                    incorporating many species of semitropical plants made gardens exceptionally
                    lush. <name type="place">California</name> designers also looked west across the
                    Pacific, especially to <name type="place">Japan</name>, for inspiration.</p>
                <p>Whether continuing the eclectic tradition of the Edwardians or subscribing to the
                    tenets of modernism, landscape design was now a much more individualistic
                    enterprise than before. Gardening was seen as an expression of personality, the
                    domain of private dreams, and such it remains today, especially in those highly
                    personal landscapes often referred to as "vernacular." The Edwardian landscape's
                    purposes were those of idyllic retreat or recreational refuge from the
                    increasing freneticism of modern life. Being essentially a place of play, it had
                    little concern for representing broadly shared philosophical perspectives or
                    displaying emblems of power. Moreover, Edwardian croquet lawns and tennis courts
                    were but a foretaste of the garden's expanding role as a place of physical
                    recreation, one that was to be extended to society at large by the many new
                    public parks built in the twentieth century. Henceforth, as the old order of
                    social hierarchy faded, its purpose was to serve the general welfare and become
                    a commodity for mass consumption.</p>

                    <p>Baron Haussmann's modernization of the city of <name type="place"
                            >Paris</name> during the reign of Napoleon III was but the first example
                        of thorough urban reconfiguration to accommodate the new forces of
                        accelerated movement brought about by the Industrial Age. Elsewhere in the
                        second half of the nineteenth century cities were being similarly
                        transformed. Vienna acquired a belt of fluid urban motion and monumental
                        modern urbanism beginning in <date when="1857">1857</date> when Emperor
                        Franz Josef I ordered the demolition of the fortifications walling the old
                        city. The area of the glacis, the sloped terrain extending in front of the
                        walls, which had long been controlled by the military, became a belt of open
                        space available for new uses. The city, which was then administered by the
                        liberal element of the bourgeoisie, employed the best Viennese architects of
                        the second half of the nineteenth century to create the broad, landscaped
                        Ringstrasse, a beltway with public green spaces and sites for important
                        ecclesiastical, civic, and educational institutions and also for new
                        residential buildings.</p>
                    <p>Though employing modern methods of construction, the architects of the
                        Ringstrasse built in a medley of borrowed styles. They applied the Gothic
                        style in designing the Rathaus, an attempt to associate this seat of
                        municipal government with the pre-imperial medieval commune governed by
                        burghers. By contrast, they deemed an early Baroque idiom appropriate for
                        the state theater, the Burgtheater, perhaps because it spoke of the time
                        when commoners were first able to join courtiers in the enjoyment of the
                        dramatic arts. These structures, together with the neo-Renaissance
                        university and the Neoclassical Parliament buildings, the latter built as a
                        gargantuan Greek temple with vastly extended wings, were oriented to the
                        broad expanse of the Ringstrasse. Contrary to the historic models they
                        evoked, these works of architecture stood isolated, lacking the frame of
                        well-defined public space. No medieval or Renaissance squares gave spatial
                        enclosure and foreground perspective to the Rathaus or the university, and
                        no monumental axes found their terminal points in the Burgtheater or the
                        Parliament. Although the buildings were set in generously landscaped space,
                        this further emphasized their isolation, heterogeneousness, and lack of
                        visible containment. It was this loss of urban spatial
                        coherence&#x2014;buildings and public spaces defined and visually enhanced
                        by one another&#x2014;that disturbed Camillo Sitte, the Austrian architect
                        and city planner who sought to stem the tide of cultural disintegration and

                            principles, and he sought to stabilize urban space by replicating the
                            square of the medieval and Renaissance townscape. In <date when="1889"

                            This remarkable essay continues still to speak to those who address
                            their attention to cityscapes and who, like Sitte, regret the sacrifice
                            of urban design to traffic engineering and the substitution of
                            technocratic utilitarian planning for artistic principles of urban
                            composition. In forming his critique, Sitte did not quarrel with
                            eclectic architecture, as modernist architects soon would. Instead, he
                            based his argument on an analysis of public spaces in classical and more
                            recent historic times, before planning had been entrusted to government
                            agency officials who had inevitably developed a systematic, formulaic
                            approach to urban design. The Greek agora and the Roman forum had been
                            vital centers of community life, and many of the Italian piazzas had
                            evolved as satisfying assemblages of architecture, sculpture, and open
                            space through an instinctive artistry spanning several generations.

                        <p>One of the first to recognize and articulate the more open character of
                            cities in the modern age as<pb n="378"/><pb n="378" type="orig"/>well as
                            their enlarged size and building scale, Sitte pointed out the failure of
                            rational planning to provide a suitable urban habitat, citing Vienna's
                            wide, windswept thoroughfares furnished with tiny islands for crossing
                            pedestrians, its unenclosed new parks that lacked the feeling of
                            tranquillity and protection found in old palace gardens, its division
                            into blocks that emphasized street frontage at the expense of interior
                            courtyard space, and the design of public squares as reservoirs of
                            traffic, rather than as places for public life. Although he realized
                            that the publication of newspapers diminished one of the functions of
                            the square&#x2014;that of exchanging information&#x2014;and that market
                            stalls had been supplanted by indoor shops, Sitte still believed that
                            artistically arranged public squares were essential elements of
                            community, necessary both visually and spiritually. Like Frederick Law
                            Olmsted, he disliked the relentless grid that ignored topographic
                            considerations and that failed to capture scenic opportunities.
                            Haussmann's <name type="place">Paris</name>, though technocratic in its
                            approach to planning and therefore conducive to the same monotonous
                            banality that was beginning to afflict Vienna and other modernizing
                            cities, was improved in Sitte's eyes by its continuation of the Baroque
                            tradition of terminating axes with monumental buildings, showing that
                            "perspective effects are possible even within the limitations imposed by
                            practical considerations."<ref target="#CH11-n1"><hi rend="sup"><hi
                                        rend="bold">1</hi></hi></ref></p>
                        <p>Sitte was willing to make concessions to utility, and he knew that modern
                            cities needed systematic planning with regard to transportation and
                            sanitation. But he deplored the division of the unbuilt city into
                            uniform blocks of land for real-estate speculation. Regarding the
                            composition of public squares, he despised as dull the convention of
                            centering monuments and applying symmetry as a uniform design principle.
                            In short, the formulaic plan was his b&#x00EA;te noire. "Whoever is to
                            succeed in upholding esthetic considerations in urban development must,"
                            he declared, "first, realize that practical solutions to traffic
                            problems are not necessarily rigid, unalterable remedies; and secondly,
                            he must be prepared to demonstrate that practical requirements of modern
                            living need not necessarily obstruct artful development."<ref

                        <p>In a final chapter, Sitte offered diagrammatic suggestions to enhance the
                            existing Ringstrasse buildings through the reconfiguration of their
                            surroundings as enclosed plazas. But his attempts to define a psychology
                            of place&#x2014;like the opposite approach of his Viennese contemporary
                            the architect Otto Wagner to aggrandize and regularize urban
                            space&#x2014;remained a utopian vision influential only in academic and
                            intellectual circles. As the head of the State Trade School, Sitte
                            advanced his Arts and Crafts ideals from within the government
                            bureaucracy, writing on bookbinding, ceramics, fountain restoration, and
                            other subjects that combined his love of the past with his sense of
                            urgent need for the aesthetic imagination to serve as a redemptive
                            social force within the framework of contemporary capitalism.</p>

                                    William Robinson and Reginald Blomfield</hi></hi></head>
                        <p>In the realm of the English garden, William Robinson (<date when="1838"
                                >1838</date>&#x2013;<date when="1935">1935</date>) promoted an Arts
                            and Crafts aesthetic at odds with the forces of scientific horticulture
                            driving much of the landscape design in his day. Like Capability Brown,
                            Robinson was a working gardener who rose to a position of exceptional
                            influence. Like John Claudius Loudon, he was effective in reaching a
                            broad audience through the pages of his garden periodicals and books.
                            But although Robinson shared Loudon's encyclopedic botanical knowledge,
                            he saw plants more in artistic than in scientific terms, and he abhorred
                            the Victorian style of carefully displayed specimen plants Loudon had
                            championed and christened the Gardenesque. For Loudon, admiration of an
                            individual plant's form was a consideration equal in importance to its
                            effect with other plants in the landscape, and for flower beds or
                            groupings of trees and shrubs he urged that each be planted near to, but
                            not touching, its neighbor. Robinson, to the contrary, envisioned garden
                            compositions with plants intermingled and sometimes intertwined as in
                            wild nature. His style was within the Picturesque tradition at the time
                            when the Picturesque's potential to create rich and varied scenes had
                            been greatly expanded by the introduction of many new species of
                            flowering plants.</p>
                        <p>Robinson's firm opinions on horticultural matters, fluently expressed in
                            peppery prose, soon led him to write for the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Gardeners' Chronicle.</hi> He was fortunate in being able to
                            communicate his ideas to an expanding and congenial audience. The
                            tremendous suburban growth around <name type="place">London</name> and
                            other British cities at the end of the nineteenth century took the form
                            of many hundreds of thousands of middle- and working-class homes with
                            garden plots.<ref target="#CH11-n3"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold"

                            to grow a wide range of plant material, with long hours of summer
                            daylight, and with sufficient money in the pockets of enough of its
                            citizens to support a flourishing nursery trade, late Victorian and
                            Edwardian <name type="place">England</name> became a nation of
                            gardeners. Poor cottagers living in old rural villages obtained gifts of
                            cuttings for their gardens, which they arranged randomly with little
                            design forethought. There was, however, considerable charm in the
                            vernacular landscape of cottagers' gardens, and Robinson saw them as a
                            rich source of ideas that sub<pb n="379"/><pb n="379" type="orig"/>urban
                            gardeners could use, particularly after he became acquainted with the
                            garden-artist and craftswoman Gertrude Jekyll, who appreciated cottage
                            gardens as much as he did. The native landscape of fields, hedgerows,
                            and woodland dells offered further inspiration (fig. 11.3). The growing
                            number of field clubs and local scientific societies and the publication
                            of handbooks on wildflowers testified to a broad general interest in
                            nature among the British. Robinson incorporated into his recommendations
                            many ideas gleaned from these sources as well as from his own rambles.
                            Ruskin's view of nature as the root of truth and beauty and his belief
                            in honorable craft as an antidote to crude mechanization added support
                            for Robinson's and Jekyll's Arts and Crafts approach to garden
                            design.</p>

                            small part to Robinson's persuasiveness in promoting Alpine
                            horticulture. Other writers had criticized bedding out of plants,
                            promoted a floral version of the Picturesque, and urged gardeners to
                            study wildflowers and to emulate the effects of field and forest, but
                            none had Robinson's flair as a publicist and none was as prolific as he.

                            journal to which both Ruskin and Gertrude Jekyll contributed. This was

                            Graphically well designed and featuring handsome engravings, these
                            magazines provided a platform from which Robinson promoted rock gardens,
                            wild gardening, and herbaceous borders. They provided a forum where he
                            could fulminate against aspects of garden taste that he despised. One
                            was the fashion for topiary, which had been revived in High Victorian
                            gardens, notably Levens Hall and Elvaston Castle, and which was later
                            advocated by Robinson's contemporary, the Ruskinian ecclesiastical

                            Robinson continued to advance his ideas in his magnum opus, <hi

                        <p>Robinson was as zealous in his attack upon Reginald Blomfield (<date

                            Blomfield championed a return to the design formality of the English
                            garden in pre-Georgian times, he did not feel that designing in the
                            manner of these old gardens was incompatible with Arts and Crafts
                            principles. His principal argument rested upon the belief that house and
                            garden should be united in a single plan in which landscape space was
                            treated as an extension of the architecture of the house. Robinson, for
                            his part, did not object to geometrical lines in the garden. For him, a
                            rectangular flower bed was, like the rectangular stretcher supporting
                            the canvas on which an artist paints a free-flowing landscape, a
                            convenient shape wherein the gardener's naturalistic effects could be
                            displayed. Both men despised William Andrew Nesfield's revival of the
                                <hi rend="italic">parterre</hi> and the Italianate grandeur of the
                            Crystal Palace Park at Sydenham. Blomfield, however, wanted to revive
                            the classicism of Christopher Wren&#x2014;so much so that his style was
                            jokingly called "Wrenaissance"&#x2014;and to return to the garden a
                            sense of enclosure, making it an architectural arrangement of outdoor
                            rooms partitioned by walls and hedges, proportioned in relation to the
                            house, and employing the principles of symmetry in its layout. He
                            perceived the unstructured naturalistic garden as an obstacle to this
                            end. As bluntly opinionated as Robinson, he asserted dogmatically that
                            "to suppose that love of nature is shown by trying to produce the
                            effects of wild nature on a small scale in a garden is clearly absurd;
                            anyone who loves natural scenery will want the real thing; he will
                            hardly be content to sit in his rockery and suppose himself to be among
                            the mountains."<ref target="#CH11-n4"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold"

                            fighting words. Heirs to a now well-established tradition of British
                            literary invective in books and articles on landscape design, Blomfield
                            and Robinson were well matched in the passion with which they espoused
                            their respective views. The word <hi rend="italic">formal,</hi> with its
                            connotation of the geometric style, was the source of some confusion. To
                            Robinson the horticulturist it should apply only "where the plants of a
                            garden are<pb n="380"/><pb n="380" type="orig"/>rigidly set out in
                            geometrical design as in carpet-gardening and bedding-out." It was also
                            for him, as for Blomfield, a synonym for <hi rend="italic"
                                >architectural,</hi> and he would confine the architect solely to
                            designing houses and some necessary grading around them. Everything else
                            was to be left to the discretion of the garden designer with his
                            superior knowledge of horticulture and claim to artistic plantsmanship.
                            Eventually the acrimony subsided, and each side could claim victory as
                            Edwardian gardens became alternatively formal and revivalistic or
                            informal and naturalistic. Increasingly, they were places where both
                            geometrical lines and painterly flower borders were at home.</p>

                        <p>The Edwardian garden designer whose reputation has endured longest is

                                >1932</date>), the first woman to act as a professional practitioner
                            in the field. By good fortune, a young architect, Edwin Landseer Lutyens
                                (<date when="1869">1869</date>&#x2013;<date when="1944"
                            >1944</date>), lived near her village of Godalming, just north of
                            Munstead Heath in Surrey, the then-rural southern county that is now a
                            heavily suburbanized part of metropolitan <name type="place"
                                >London</name>. Their friendship flourished on both a personal level
                            and as a fruitful collaboration over several years. It was one that
                            embodied both designers' deep respect for rural English vernacular
                            building and gardening idioms. At the heart of their achievement was the
                            conviction Jekyll undoubtedly conveyed to Lutyens regarding the
                            importance of sensitive site planning.</p>
                        <p>As a girl, Jekyll read Ruskin's works avidly. Ruskin's deep respect for
                            handicrafts and the artisan worker would remain a chief influence and
                            moral guide for Jekyll the rest of her life. In <date when="1861"
                                >1861</date>, the same year William Morris started his crafts firm
                            and a time when higher education was gradually opening to women, Jekyll
                            enrolled in the South Kensington School of Art. Here she learned drawing
                            and color theory and experienced the influence of Owen Jones, a crafts
                            designer and student of Moorish, Italian, and Chinese ornament who had
                            served as superintendent of the Great Exhibition of <date when="1851"
                                >1851</date> as well as joint director of decoration for the Crystal
                            Palace at Sydenham. Introductions to both Ruskin and Morris, whose
                            International Exhibition of his firm's craft products she had probably
                            visited in <date when="1862">1862</date>, confirmed her in her course as
                            an artist. She chose to be both a painter and a craftswoman, accepting
                            many commissions for silver jewelry, embroideries, and inlaid woodwork,
                            although, as a well-to-do woman from a prominent family, she could not
                            defy social convention by formally establishing herself in business. In
                                <date when="1876">1876</date>, after her father's death, she went to
                            live with her mother in Munstead House, where, with a nature that craved
                            a large degree of privacy and tranquillity, she was happy to continue
                            her arts and crafts pursuits in the rural quietude of Surrey.</p>
                        <p>In <date when="1883">1883</date>, Jekyll purchased a 15-acre triangular
                            plot of land opposite Munstead House, "fifteen acres of the poorest
                            possible soil," the site of her garden and future home, Munstead Wood.
                            Here she began developing a garden of woodland walks. She was severely
                            afflicted by myopia&#x2014;nearsightedness&#x2014;and as this condition
                            progressed, she was forced to abandon even close work. By <date
                                when="1891">1891</date>, her physician's prognosis of further
                            deterioration caused her to throw more of her considerable artistic
                            energy into gardening, which she was already pursuing with passionate
                            interest. With the help of her brother she had taken up photography a
                            few years earlier, and this gave her another visual medium of
                            expression.</p>

                            assisted her in conceiving garden schemes less in terms of individual
                            plants than as shapes, textures, and broad masses of color with single
                            varieties often arranged to maximum optical<pb n="381"/><pb n="381"

                            (fig. 11.5). Like the Impressionist Claude Monet (<date when="1840"
                                >1840</date>&#x2013;<date when="1926">1926</date>), who was
                            simultaneously creating his garden at Giverny both as a painterly
                            expression in horticulture and a subject to be painted, Jekyll saw her
                            garden as a series of seasonal scenes, appearing like pictures in a
                            gallery with different exhibitions planned throughout the year. Not for
                            her were Loudon's botanically ordered plant specimens. Glass houses,
                            pridefully displayed in Victorian gardens, were removed in hers to
                            hidden corners to serve purely practical ends. Her gardener's credo,
                            expressed in <hi rend="italic">Colour Schemes for the Flower Garden</hi>
                                (<date when="1914">1914</date>), was deceptively simple:<q>I am

                                number, does not make a garden; it only makes a <hi rend="italic"

                                in our gardens is so to use the plants that they shall form
                                beautiful pictures.<ref target="#CH11-n5"><hi rend="sup"><hi

                        <p>Her easy and engaging style of writing was nurtured by her career as a
                            garden columnist, first with the <hi rend="italic">Guardian
                                Newspaper</hi> and later as a contributor to William Robinson's
                            magazine <hi rend="italic">The Garden,</hi> which she coedited for a
                            brief period following his retirement in <date when="1899">1899</date>.
                            She wrote the section on color for <hi rend="italic">The English Flower
                                Garden,</hi> which was republished in several subsequent editions of
                            Robinson's popular book, and she contributed photographs of plants to
                            serve as the basis of engravings in all editions after the second. In
                                <date when="1899">1899</date>, drawing material from her <hi
                                rend="italic">Guardian</hi> columns, she published a book of her
                            own, <hi rend="italic">Wood and Garden.</hi> She illustrated it with
                            sixty-five of her own photographs, including many she had taken of
                            cottagers at work in their gardens and woodmen competently felling trees
                            with the time-honored tools she admired. Her prose is sensuous and
                            vivid, and seasonal change, with the rhythm of the agrarian calendar
                            dictating the gardener's rounds, remains a theme in all her books.</p>
                        <p>Book publication brought Jekyll increased celebrity and assisted her in
                            building a design practice with her architect, friend, and
                            prot&#x00E9;g&#x00E9;, Edwin Lutyens. Their common aesthetic grew as he
                            rode with her in a pony cart through the byways of Surrey admiring
                            vernacular architecture. In Lutyens, Jekyll felt she had found someone
                            whom she could trust to provide the elements of architectonic structure
                            and domestic comfort needed to complement her visions of nature
                            perfected. He, in turn, was grateful to his sometimes overbearing, but
                            immensely helpful mentor, who imparted to him her Ruskinian sympathies,
                            Arts and Crafts ideals, and deep appreciation of a vanishing <name
                                type="place">England</name>. His genius lay in his ability to fuse
                            these elements with an architectural style that embodied many of the
                            formal principles enunciated by Blomfield.</p>
                        <p>Socially conservative, Jekyll wanted to preserve the old class structure
                            of masters and servants. But far from wishing to make the humble
                            cottages of rural villages disappear from the improved landscape, as had
                            been the case in the eighteenth century when lands were enclosed and
                            great estate gardens such as Stowe created, she was in the vanguard of

                            succumbing to the modern age of industrialization, she wanted to save
                            its building and craft traditions and to incorporate their techniques of
                            brick, stone, and ironwork, along with the rustic charm of cottage
                            gardens, into the style she and Lutyens were forging together. She also
                            wanted to record the folkways and old agricultural methods that
                            represented a venerable craft tradition even as new farm machinery and
                            aspirations to transcend village poverty were causing these to
                            vanish.</p>

                            and garden join in a mutual embrace. The house opens itself to the
                            garden and incorporates the garden into its Paved Court, which is
                            constructed of the same local stone as the house and edged with low
                            boxwood hedges. At the north end of the Paved Court is the Tank Garden,
                            where a rectangular pool is framed by stepped paving and lush plantings
                            of ferns and canna lilies. Semicircular aprons of paving on either side
                            of the pool mark the end of this formal construction where two garden
                            paths, the Nut Walk and the path beside the October Michaelmas daisy
                            border, lead to a Pergola and Summerhouse, beyond which lies Jekyll's
                            180-foot-(54.9-meter) long Main Flower Border, Garden of Summer Flowers,
                            and Spring Garden.</p>
                        <p>The south and west sides of the house face a lawn and the adjoining
                            woodland where, according to Jekyll, "much care has been given to the

                            not been cut when the property was a woodlot. Masses of rhododendrons
                            carefully selected for their floral color were underplanted with hardy
                            ferns, small andromedas, wild heaths, and the blue-flowered <hi

                            wild nature in its most generous state.</p>
                        <p>Jekyll's camera recorded many beautiful garden pictures at Munstead Wood
                            over the years. Because of her growing reputation as a garden writer and
                            photographer, she met Edward Hudson, the publisher, who, in <date

                            estates, Jekyll's participation added greater horticultural content and
                            a focus upon small country houses, domestic establishments like her own
                            Munstead Wood where the owner substituted for a head gardener in
                            directing the work of a small gardening staff. Her first article
                            described Orchards, the house and garden that she and Lutyens were then
                            completing for her neighbors <name type="pname">William</name> and <name

                            the Arts and Crafts movement, Mallet sought inspiration for the
                            exquisitely harmonized floral tones of his superb collection of
                            rhododendrons from medieval stained glass as well as from his collection
                            of old embroidered fabrics, mostly clerical vestments. From Jekyll's <hi
                                rend="italic">Wood and Garden</hi> he derived the idea of
                            introducing into the park Chinese azaleas (<hi rend="italic">Azalea
                                mollis</hi>) in a succession of carefully graded tones ranging from
                            pale yellow to bright orangy red.</p>
                        <p>The Jekyll-Lutyens collaboration continued until her advancing age and
                            his rise to professional prominence, culminating in a knighthood,
                            brought it to a gradual halt. Increasingly, Lutyens moved toward
                            formality while still maintaining his originality as an architect.
                            Although conceived in the so-called Anglo-Indian style, his plan for New

                        <p>The iconography of Villandry's noteworthy Jardin d'Ornement has more to

                                when="1930">1930</date>), Achille Duch&#x00EA;ne's and Dr. Joachim
                            de Carvallo's contemporary, had a less reactionary temperament and
                            restorationist bent. His was a flexible style that mediated between
                            several trends: a return to Neoclassical formality, the legacy of <hi
                                rend="italic">the jardin anglais,</hi> an Arts and Crafts aesthetic,
                            and the innovations of modernism. As an employee of the <name
                                type="place">Paris</name> Parks and Promenades administration after
                                <date when="1887">1887</date>, Forestier restored Thomas Blaikie's
                            late-eighteenth-century <hi rend="italic">jardin-anglais</hi> on the
                            grounds of Bagatelle as a public park, leaving in place some of the
                            garden's remaining<hi rend="italic"> fabriques</hi> and reintroducing
                            French formality in the more architectonic lines of the new perennial
                            and rose gardens (fig. 11.13). Forestier was also responsible for
                            restoring Sceaux, the masterful landscape Le Nôtre had created for
                            Colbert (see fig. 5.16). But his style ranged beyond that of French and
                            English inspiration, incorporating such Islamic and Mediterranean
                            features as patios and patterned tiles. This eclecticism was nourished
                            by Forestier's international landscape practice. Like Duch&#x00EA;ne,
                            Forestier grappled with the challenge of designing gardens for the
                            relatively small-scale private properties of a still wealthy but less
                            landed clientele. His ability to amalgamate an Arts and Crafts
                            horticultural palette, formal elements derived from Renaissance garden
                            tradition, and Mediterranean and Islamic motifs in an original manner
                            can be seen in the garden he designed for the Parque de Montjuich
                            (Montju&#x00EF;c) in Barcelona in <date when="1918">1918</date> (fig.

                            creativity, and respect for regional materials and local scenery was
                            part of a general stylistic trend adopted by various architects,
                            landscape designers, and aesthetes well into the twentieth century. In
                            addition to countering industrialization and mass production with
                            artisan workmanship, the Arts and Crafts movement in Great Britain was,
                            as we have seen, nationalistic, a preservationist effort to uphold
                            English vernacular traditions. Even so, this commitment to "Englishness"
                            was being undermined by Beaux-Arts influence in much the same way as the
                            American style of Olmsted and Vaux was being challenged by Daniel
                            Burnham and the Neoclassical architects who projected a new
                            monumentalism and rectilinear axiality in American architecture and city

                            as inspiration for a landscape style that expressed their
                            art-for-art's-sake philosophy in different terms from those of the
                            English vernacular tradition. They saw the sixteenth-century and
                            early-seventeenth-century villas of <name type="place">Italy</name> as
                            models to emulate. Peto developed Italian themes in his own garden at
                            Ilford Manor, near Bradford-on-Avon, Wiltshire, gaining the admiration
                            of Jekyll, who included some of his design details in her book <hi

                            At Ilford Manor and in the gardens he designed for clients, Peto
                            terraced slopes, marked grade changes with balustrades atop retaining
                            walls, created graceful staircases with side walls terminating in
                            finial-topped pillars or columns holding antique statuary, and built
                            casinos and colonnades overlooking tanks of water lilies (fig. 11.15).

                            several gardens he showed that he could manipulate water, one of the
                            principal ingredients of Italian gardens, with considerable originality.

                            Four and Five. Their lines softened by lichened stone and overgrown

                            offered&#x2014;constituted the essence of Italian garden design. At The

                                <name type="place">Massachusetts</name>, Wharton set about designing
                            a <name type="place">New England</name> version of an Italian garden
                            (fig. 11.19). Her niece, the landscape designer <name type="pname"

                            wishing to establish an American version appropriate to the topography
                            and traditions of <name type="place">New England</name>, Wharton laid
                            out a series of grassy terraces bordered with hemlock hedges, which she
                            linked axially to the house. She connected these to a long cross axis, a
                            300-foot-long (91.4-meter-long) walk bordered by linden trees with a <hi

                        <p>Like Blomfield, Platt was interested in uniting architectural and
                            landscape space. This was what the Italian villa designers, who
                            conceived of house and garden as integral parts of a single plan, had
                            done. In Cornish, New Hampshire, the summer art colony of which Platt
                            was a member, he developed on five properties, including his own, an
                            American version of the Italian villa, in which he created axial
                            alignments, descending terraced slopes, and garden spaces shaped by
                            architectural greenery as outdoor living rooms.</p>

                            Platt designed a garden<pb n="388"/><pb n="388" type="orig"/>for <name

                                Pratt Sprague</name> (fig. 11.20). The steep grade of the site was
                            conducive to creating a gridded <hi rend="italic">bosco</hi> with a
                            circular temple in the center on the hillside above the entry court and
                            on axis with the principal entrance to the house. Below the house, Platt
                            designed the spacious lawn as a transition between garden and forest,
                            taking advantage of the slope to create a series of descending grass
                            terraces overlooking the western range of hills. As Olmsted had done at
                            Biltmore and Moraine Farm, Platt withheld this panoramic view from
                            immediate sight by placing a screen of densely planted trees alongside
                            the long entrance drive on both sides of the entry court. He had
                            lamented the decay of many of the flower-filled <hi rend="italic"
                                >giardini segreti</hi> that had once vivified Italian gardens, and
                            now at Faulkner Farm he laid out a large rectangular flower garden
                            terminating at the far end in a horseshoe-shaped pergola and pavilion
                            modeled, like those designed by Peto, on one of Cardinal Gambera's at
                            Villa Lante (fig. 11.21).</p>

                            career as a designer of houses and gardens that met the demand for what
                            was hailed at the time as a new American landscape architecture.
                            Italian-inspired, enriched by Arts and Crafts plantsmanship, the
                            relaxed, historically evocative style that Platt helped create adapted a
                            borrowed idiom to the American scene. As the republican values of the
                            generation of Downing and Olmsted were replaced by those of the Gilded
                            Age, the Italianate style became an expression of the cultural status of
                            the successful industrialists and financiers who saw themselves as the
                            successors of the Italian princes of the Renaissance, the collectors of
                            artworks commissioned by the Medicis. Now, in democratic <name
                                type="place">America</name>, these latter-day Medicis had become
                            builders of city palaces and country villas. Beaux-Arts training and
                                <name type="place">Rome</name> prize fellowships at the American
                            Academy continued to be the primary path of career preparation for
                            architects and landscape architects in the United States until World War
                            II. For this reason one finds both in the planning of public parks and
                            in the gardens of private estates a long-lingering debt to the
                            principles of this style of neoclassical design.</p>

                    <p>The incomprehensibility of vast social change as the entire religious and
                        cultural underpinnings of a once-stable society is swept away by great tidal
                        forces in the history of human affairs and the life of the human mind is the
                        subject of Matthew Arnold's great, sad poem "Dover Beach" (<date when="1867"
                            >1867</date>). Its intimation of Western civilization's confusion and
                        disarray was hardly heeded by Arnold's countrymen, the prosperous British
                        aristocrats and industrialists who felt secure in the glory of their
                        nation's empire over which a never-setting sun still shone.</p>
                    <p>But the Faustian power unleashed by the Industrial Revolution, the source of
                        much economic prosperity, was demoniacally driving the science of war toward
                        new and hideous ends of destruction while also propelling the great social
                        transformations foreseen by Karl Marx. Nevertheless, from the perspective of
                        those living at the turn of the twentieth century, the tragic upheaval of
                        World War I and the Russian Revolution still lay a few years in the future,
                        and even as these came to pass there were those whose fortunes survived.
                        Before turning in Chapter Twelve to examine the landscapes of a visionary
                        modernity as Western societies became more broadly democratic in the wake of
                        their social transformations, we will examine a few more of the estate
                            gar<pb n="389"/><pb n="389" type="orig"/>dens of this lingering
                        aristocracy. Reduced in scale as new taxes eroded many old fortunes and
                        rising labor costs curtailed maintenance budgets, these
                        early-twentieth-century landscapes were still gracious if no longer
                        grand.</p>
                    <p>World War I brought the era of country-house building to a halt in <name
                            type="place">England</name> and ended what has been called the Edwardian
                        Golden Afternoon&#x2014;a time when a privileged segment of society enjoyed
                        garden teas, lawn tennis, and touring quiet country roads by bicycle and
                        another new machine of the Industrial Age, the motor car. Still, Lutyens and
                        Jekyll continued to collaborate. Now, however, when the two old friends
                        worked together, it was on plans for soldiers' cemeteries, as the Imperial
                        War Graves Commission had appointed Lutyens, along with Blomfield, principal
                        architect for the ones in <name type="place">France</name>. But the domestic
                        garden design idiom Jekyll and Lutyens had earlier forged was one that would
                        serve well the postwar generation of estate owners, whose smaller properties
                        and budgets did not allow the large-scale efforts of prior periods. The Arts
                        and Crafts tradition pioneered by Robinson and the Jekyll-Lutyens
                        partnership as it was fused with the Beaux-Arts style and the influence of
                        Italian gardens found many notable expressions in the first half of the
                        twentieth century. The style extends to the present day, and many of its
                        finest practitioners were and are women. In part this was because the
                        association of landscape architecture with the domestic realm made it seem
                        more socially acceptable than female employment in some other
                        professions.</p>
                    <p>With the writings of <name type="pname">Robinson</name>, <name type="pname"
                            >Jekyll</name>, and <name type="pname">Blomfield</name> and the lessons
                        of Italian villa garden designers thoroughly assimilated and harmonized, the
                        character of the early-twentieth-century English garden was now an agreeable
                        stylistic amalgam of influences in which abundant, painterly herbaceous
                        borders were happily incorporated into plans disciplined by architectonic
                        principles. With unbounded prospect no longer necessarily possible or
                        desirable as privacy and enclosure became design objectives once more, the
                        eighteenth century's premium on unbroken openness was thoroughly
                        invalidated. Although some naturalistic planting was found useful in
                        blending the edges of the garden with the larger landscape beyond,
                        Capability Brown, who had served before as a target of criticism for those
                        advocating a different landscape style, came in for censure once again. It
                        was a backward-looking time in which innovation lay in cherishing the
                        British medieval and Tudor past and harmonizing this native heritage in an
                        aesthetically agreeable manner with elements borrowed from the historic
                        period styles of other countries.</p>

                            design as a careful selection from a menu of styles. Mawson, the first

                            "idealists," that is "old garden designers [who created] many stately
                            avenues, grand parterres, quiet alleys, shady walks, sparking fountains,
                            quaint hedges, architectural ponds and broad unbroken lawns, which in
                            many cases are wedded together in such a masterly way, as to impress the

                            the "realists," who tried to imitate nature but came to rely on
                            serpentine lines to the point where "undulation became a stock
                            accomplishment." Mawson admired Repton, however&#x2014;not the earlier
                            Picturesque landscape gardener, but rather the later advocate of the
                            "Gardenesque."</p>
                        <p>Mawson promoted a return to the "truthful simplicity" of old gardens. He
                            acknowledged, however, that "naturalism has, under certain conditions,
                            its legitimate use and place in the creation of garden and park effects;
                            and that a compromise between these two opposites or a combination of
                            the two is at times the only method by which we can obtain anything like
                            an effective whole."<ref target="#CH11-n12"><hi rend="sup"><hi

                            more eclectic than Italianate. His style can best be summarized as a
                            combination of Arts and Crafts flowers and topiary, Beaux-Arts
                            unification of house and garden through axial planning, and the merging
                            of these two influences with the curvilinear "naturalesque," as he
                            called the informal style of garden design (fig. 11.22).</p>

                            creating "pictures" was akin to Jekyll's. At Sutton Courtenay,
                            Berkshire, her home after <date when="1895">1895</date>, she created a
                            series of garden compartments divided by stone walls and yew hedges.
                            There was a Hornbeam Alley, a Persian Garden, and a Long Garden filled
                            with topiary. Lindsay, who valued serendipity, admitted into her gardens

                            weeds&#x2014;because they added an element of charming surprise (fig.
                            11.23). In the tradition of Robinson and Jekyll, she also created a wild
                            garden, and, like Jekyll, served as a garden consultant to friends. She
                            belongs to a special class of gardener whose passionate attachment to a
                            particular place and to garden art amounts to a source of ecstasy.

                            used farm machinery to grade the land, manipulating the topography to
                            achieve different ground levels and to play tricks of foreshortening by
                            creating barely perceptible slopes, as in the case of the grassy walk
                            through the Red Borders to the twin pavilions guarding the entrance to
                            the Stilt Garden (fig. 11.25). Spatial definition is one of the chief
                            assets of Hidcote, and the pleasurable scale of the garden is enhanced
                            by the way in which Johnston formed "walls" with hedges of yew, holly,
                            box, and beech, interweaving them to provide different textures and
                            shades of green.</p>
                        <p>The architectural lines of the garden form a foil for the perennial

                            juxtapositions as hers. He became an avid botanist, traveling to Africa
                            and China to gamer rarities that he could naturalize at Hidcote. Color
                            was an important consideration. In Mrs. Winthrop's Garden, named in
                            honor of his mother, he planted only yellow-flowered plants and those

                        <p>Harold Nicholson deemed himself a classicist, and although his cast of
                            mind was not as fervently romantic as his wife's, he may have yearned as

                            modes of thought, there was room for reconciliation: "It would seem
                            indeed as if the misunderstanding that arises between the romantic and
                            the classical temperament is due, not so much to any conflict between
                            the imagination and reason, as to the fact that whereas the classic
                            finds pleasure in recognition, the romantic derives his own greatest
                            stimulus from surprise."<ref target="#CH11-n15"><hi rend="sup"><hi

                        <p>Nicholson faced considerable difficulty in developing axes and classical
                            geometries within the old manor's footprint. The spaces formed by old
                            walls and structures, including a moat, contained many obtuse angles. In
                            compromising his penchant for the classical in order to harmonize an
                            abstract ideal with the reality of the ground, Nicholson arrived at
                            something more akin to the plan of Hadrian's Villa, with its
                            independent, impinging axes, than that of an Italianate or
                            Beaux-Arts-style garden where axial coherence and geometric regularity
                            predominate (see fig. 2.43).</p>

                            lines, scale, and proportion. The garden beds within these spaces
                            constituted the loom upon which Vita Sackville-West wove a brocade of
                            floral pictures in subtle textures and sophisticated color harmonies.
                            Her most celebrated inspiration was the creation of the White Garden,
                            where white flowers and silvery leaves catch the lingering daylight and
                            shine forth in moonlight (fig. 11.28).</p>

                            satisfaction to those who can afford a country retreat. Borrowing from
                            the fused tradition of Jekyll, Peto, and their contemporaries, British
                            gardeners such as Penelope Hobhouse and Rosemary Veery perpetuate the
                            Arts and Crafts <hi rend="italic">cum</hi> Neoclassical heritage in
                            garden design. Theirs is a preservationist style that evokes a bygone
                                <name type="place">England</name> of old manor houses, embowered
                            cottages, and the long dream of <name type="place">Italy</name>. At the
                            same time, practitioners in this vein are extremely sophisticated,
                            combining in original and often stunning ways newer hybrids with simple
                            native varieties and plants with venerable horticultural histories, such
                            as old-fashioned roses. In spite of this stylistic continuity lasting to
                            the present day, Sissinghurst, created on the eve of World War II,
                            symbolizes the end of an era. The postwar social agenda in <name

                            Edwardians and their Victorian predecessors impossible to sustain.
                            Generally speaking, the same thing was true in the United States.</p>

                        as had William Waldorf Astor (<date when="1848">1848</date>&#x2014; <date

                        Castle have never been surpassed as reflections of wealth and social status.
                        Those who, like Lawrence Johnson, were less inclined toward opulence took up

                        or in the counties of Surrey and Sussex in the south, centers of the Arts

                        Although concessions to climate, topography, and native scenery continued to
                        be relevant concerns, the emulation of European examples and the perfection
                        of European styles became for a time more important than the search for an
                        original American landscape design idiom.</p>
                    <p>As we have seen, artistically inclined people and writers such as Henry James
                        and Edith Wharton, with sufficient leisure and income to make regular
                        extensive trips to Europe or take up residence abroad, sought escape as
                        tourists and expatriates from what they perceived to be American
                        philistinism. Architects continued to train in <name type="place"

                        for their crass commercialism, but they nevertheless funded the continuation
                        of large country estates. World War II would bring this way of life to an
                        end, just as World War I had brought near-closure to the privileged life of

                            professions open to them at the beginning of the twentieth century. The

                                <date when="1916">1916</date> helped open a career path to women
                            wishing to enter the field. Like Beatrice Farrand, Ellen Biddle Shipman
                                (<date when="1869">1869</date>&#x2013;<date when="1950"
                            >1950</date>), who received her training in the office of Charles Platt,
                            ran an all-woman landscape architectural firm. As in the case of
                            Farrand, Shipman's entry into the field was facilitated by her
                            horticultural knowledge and an ability to provide planting plans for
                            Platt and other landscape designers such as Warren Manning. Because she
                            did not travel to Europe until <date when="1929">1929</date>, when she
                            was sixty years old, her independent work was less influenced by foreign
                            examples than that of Farrand or the <name type="place">Rome</name>
                            prizewinners, who were her contemporaries. It can best be characterized
                            as an application of Jekyll's lessons to a traditional Colonial-revival
                            style&#x2014;a marriage of Arts and Crafts planting principles with the
                            geometrical layout of old-fashioned American gardens&#x2014;or, put
                            another way, a translation of formal design into a more relaxed,
                            domestic vernacular. It was a style that was both sophisticated and
                            unpretentious.</p>
                        <p>Shipman and her husband, Louis, were part of the artists' colony in
                            Cornish, New Hampshire, which included <name type="pname">Charles

                            including the requisite engineering skills to develop extensive grading
                            and drainage plans. Nevertheless, in <date when="1920">1920</date>, she
                            opened an office in <name type="place">New York</name> City. Because her
                            work was almost exclusively residential, she did not seek membership in
                            the recently formed, male-dominated American Society of Landscape
                            Architects. Nevertheless, she found a substantial niche within the
                            profession. The young Garden Club of America&#x2014;a national
                            organization supporting the work of many local garden clubs throughout
                            the country&#x2014;had stimulated an interest in horticulture among
                            affluent women. They provided Shipman with a natural client base and
                            network of referrals for commissions&#x2014;more than six hundred during
                            her years of professional practice. Many of her jobs were undertaken in
                            collaboration with other landscape architects, including Charles Platt,
                            Warren Manning, and Fletcher Steele.</p>
                        <p>Able landscape photographers such as Mattie Edwards Hewitt recorded the
                            appearance of many of Shipman's gardens (fig. 11.36). Publication of

                                n="397" type="orig"/>idyllic seclusion and well-guarded privacy. As
                            a rule, Shipman screened the borders of her gardens with heavy
                            plantings. Her "secret" gardens were spaces for dreamy contemplation as
                            well as for inticreated a conservative reaction mate socializing with
                            family and friends. Smallscale works of sculpture inject notes of fancy
                            and function as pleasing garden decor. Their meaning is secondary, for
                            by the twentieth century mythology no longer had allegorical
                            significance for designer or client but served as a branch of
                            storytelling, providing a genteel foretaste of the role of fantasy in
                            the thematic landscapes of the present day.</p>
                        <p>Shipman's planting schemes were typically accompanied by detailed
                            horticultural instructions intended to ensure proper maintenance by
                            clients and their gardeners. In addition, she made regular visits to
                            estates where her designs were installed, and some clients put her in
                            charge of administering annual discretionary funds for plant purchases.
                            Her practice was far-flung, and she spent a great deal of time traveling
                            by train and later by plane to job sites all over the United States. The
                            Sarah P. Duke Memorial Gardens at Duke University in North Carolina was
                            one of her most significant designs. Because she socialized with her
                            clients, who introduced her to their friends, many of whom also hired
                            her, she had clusters of commissions in such places as <name

                            Grosse Point, Michigan; the North Shore of Long Island; and Mount Kisco,
                                <name type="place">New York</name>. In these pockets of affluence,
                            until the exigencies of World War II brought commissions to a virtual
                            halt, Shipman designed idyllic gardens, historically inflected refuges
                            from the modern industrial scene&#x2014;ironically, the source of wealth
                            that enabled many of the gardens to exist in the first place.</p>

                            design into a distinctive, if eclectic, regional style. Because the
                            state enjoys some spectacular hilly and mountainous scenery and has
                            along its coast what is known as a Mediterranean climate, it was
                            especially congenial to the creation of Italianate and Spanish-style
                            gardens. Although the Anglo-American railroad barons and other
                            capitalists who first settled the state created gardens within the
                            prevailing nineteenth-century Picturesque tradition, they soon began to
                            capture the opportunities inherent in the mild climate, which, combined
                            with irrigation technology, permitted the introduction of species of
                            eucalyptus and other semitropical plants from <name type="place"

                            frontier spirit also served to foster a lifestyle less circumscribed by
                            social convention than that of the Eastern seaboard. Helen Hunt

                                >1884</date>), written to call attention to federal policy
                            injustices toward Native Americans and Hispanics, drew a romantic
                            portrait of <name type="place">California</name>'s pre-Anglo way of life
                            with its Franciscan missions and Spanish haciendas. This stimulated some

                            and gave birth to the Mission Revival style and other design
                            interpretations of a mythical regional past, notably the somewhat later
                            Spanish Colonial style. In this attempt to forge a regional identity and
                            to project an architecture compatible with the newly enriched vegetal
                            repertory, designers appropriated various Mediterranean styles, with
                            principal emphasis on that of Andalusian Spain. In urban design terms,
                            this is best seen in Santa Barbara where, after the earthquake of <date

                            at this private fantasy weekend "resort."</p>
                        <p>Although eastern architects such as Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue (<date

                            the handful of resident professionals who received commissions to design
                            houses and gardens on <name type="place">California</name> estates in
                            the <date when="1920">1920</date>s, amateurs and nurserymen were
                            responsible for laying out some of the most notable ones. Goodhue was
                            the architect in charge of the <date when="1915">1915</date>
                                Panama-<name type="place">California</name> Exposition held in San
                            Diego. In opposition to Irving Gill and others who saw this as an
                            opportunity to forge a simpler, more modern regional idiom, Goodhue
                            deemed a neo-traditional Spanish Colonial Baroque style to be the most
                            desirable one for the fair's buildings. The landscape designers matched
                            its architectural flamboyance with a riot of lush semitropical
                            vegetation arranged in extravagant floral displays. The fair gave
                            license to an unbridled eclecticism, and the opulent tone it set was
                            highly influential. Not only did various forms of Spanish and Mexican
                            architecture become popular, but direct imitation of Italian villa
                            architecture and gardens was widely practiced.</p>
                        <p>A nurseryman, <name type="pname">A. E. Hanson</name>, was inspired by the
                            fair to seek his living as a designer of great estates. With
                            entrepreneurial energy and a flair for salesmanship, Hanson became a
                            landscape contractor, hiring the design and horticultural talent he
                            needed to fulfill his commissions. In his breezy memoir, he tells how he
                            succeeded in getting the job to design Greenacres, movie millionaire
                            Harold Lloyd's 16-acre estate in Beverly Hills. Working with golf course
                            designer Billy Bell and architect Sumner Spaulding, he created between
                                <date when="1925">1925</date> and <date when="1929">1929</date> a
                            grandiose scheme that included a 100-foot (30.5-meter) waterfall
                            spilling into a canoe course that also served as a water hazard for the
                            golf course, a fairy-tale English village play yard with a thatched roof
                            cottage and pony stable for Lloyd's three-year-old daughter, a "Villa
                            Lante" cascade, a "Villa Medici" fountain, and a "Villa d'Este" pool.
                            The house was modeled on the Villa Gamberaia (fig. 11.40).</p>

                            to create gardens for such Hollywood executives as director George Cukor
                            and producer <name type="pname">Jack Warner</name>. She was given a
                            budget of $100,000, a lavish sum at the time, for landscaping Warner's
                            18-acre Southern-plantation-style estate, located near Harold Lloyd's
                            and those of several other famous movie stars in Beverly Hills' Benedict
                            Canyon. But, like Hanson, Yoch found in Montecito the conditions that
                            inspired what is perhaps her finest creation, Il Brolino, the fey
                            topiary garden she designed on the 7-acre estate of lumber heiress Mary
                            Stewart to complement George <name type="place">Washington</name>
                            Smith's handsome Italian-villa-style house (fig. 11.42). Here one sees
                            the flexibility of her imagination in the way she softened the garden's
                            geometrical lines with the fat, rounded, whimsical forms of animals and
                            playing-card symbols in clipped boxwood, artfully juxtaposed against the
                            background trees and mountains beyond. This quality is also apparent in
                            her habit of modifying symmetry with adjustments to site conditions and
                            the occasional eccentric placement of a tree or other object within an
                            otherwise formal space.</p>

                                >Florida</name> was originally a Spanish colonial borderland with a
                            climate that became a lure for resort builders and affluent escapees
                            from the northern winter. Some built great estates, employing design
                            idioms similar to those used in <name type="place">California</name>.
                            One of the most extravagantly spectacular Italianate gardens of the
                            Gilded Age is Vizcaya, built between <date when="1912">1912</date> and

                            manufacturer. F. Burrall Hoffman, Jr., designed the house as a boldly
                            eclectic pastiche, with each facade portraying a different era of
                            Italian villa architecture. Hoffman's artistically inclined friend, Paul
                            Chalfin, helped him garner the tapestries and furniture to create the
                            grand decorative effects that lend the interior its air of opulence.
                            Diego Suarez, a Colombian who was tutored in landscape design at La
                            Pietra by Arthur Acton, created the elaborate gardens, which combine

                        <p>Vizcaya was a bellwether, stimulating rich Easterners and eventually the

                            Promoted by the entrepreneur Henry Flagler, Palm Beach became a

                                York</name>. His career was given a tremendous boost after <date
                                when="1918">1918</date> when he discovered Palm Beach and its
                            potential as an American Riviera. With some of the same eclectic
                            imagination and flair for client relations as <name type="pname">A. E.
                                Hanson</name>, Mizner, who was widely traveled and a collector of
                            antiques and architectural artifacts from all over the world, invented
                            virtually single-handedly the Palm Beach style, a pseudo-Hispanic
                            amalgam of dramatic decorative effects. Mizner took complete charge of
                            his clients' projects, serving as architect, interior decorator, and
                            landscape designer.</p>
                        <p>Though physically distant, as resort communities with a similar ethos of
                            self-invented domestic and urbanistic stagecraft and a common
                            Hispanic-Italianate-Mediterranean appearance, Santa Barbara and Palm
                            Beach were close cousins. Mizner, in fact, took the skills he perfected
                            in <name type="place">Florida</name> to <name type="pname"
                                >Parklane</name>, an estate in Santa Barbara where he combined
                            Venetian Gothic elements with images derived from the Villa Lante. Thus
                            did wealthy Americans of this period commission designers to take
                            recipes from the European banquet and concoct architectural menus of
                            cribbed grandeur intended to surpass the original models. Sometimes
                            blatantly, as in the gardens of <name type="pname">A. E. Hanson</name>
                            and elsewhere more subtly, as in the gardens of Platt, Farrand, and
                            Shipman, we find evidence of the transformation of garden art into
                            garden style.</p>
                        <p>Resort communities such as <name type="pname">Santa Barbara</name> and
                            Palm Beach are phenomena of machine-age technology&#x2014;beautiful and
                            remote places made accessible by private railroad car (later by private
                            jet). The cost of transportation for their temporary residents, among
                            other factors, ensured their status as exclusive enclaves, especially in
                            their early years. Commercial rail and aviation and, more significant,
                            mass production of the twentieth-century machine par excellence, the
