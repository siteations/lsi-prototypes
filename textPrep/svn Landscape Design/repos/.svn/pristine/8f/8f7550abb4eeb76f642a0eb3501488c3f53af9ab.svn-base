                <p><hi rend="bold">T</hi>he seventeenth century saw the birth of scientific
                    modernism in Western culture. A probing inquiry into the nature of nature, the
                    growing reliance on inductive reasoning, and a new confidence based upon a
                    continuously expanding understanding of the universe was paralleled in landscape
                    design by the extension of axes beyond the boundaries of the garden. The
                    universe and all nature were now perceived in dimensions far grander and more
                    indeterminate than those imagined by the Christian theologians and Aristotelian
                    scholastics of the Middle Ages, or even by the Renaissance humanists whose
                    curiosity and methods of inquiry helped build a bridge between the medieval and
                    modern worldviews.</p>
                <p>As we saw in Chapter Five, confidence in human power and growing dominion over
                    nature as well as celebration of the intelligible order of nature revealed by
                    science infused the work of <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name> and other
                    seventeenth-century landscape designers. They had by this time completely
                    abandoned the imagery inherent in the <hi rend="italic">hortus conclusus</hi>,
                    the garden as a sanctified precinct set apart from the world at large. Instead,
                    they laid out long axes that stretched to the horizon and built monuments that
                    celebrated human authority and achievement.</p>
                <p>The increased power that human beings perceived themselves to hold over their own
                    destiny grew in tandem with the power of nation-states and the
                    institutionalization of monarchical government. <name type="pname">Louis
                        XIV</name> created at <name type="place">Versailles</name> the ultimate
                    symbol of autocratic rule, and the value of that landscape in bolstering a royal
                    reputation was not lost upon the other princes of <name type="place"
                        >Europe</name>. The growing power of states necessitated a concomitant
                    increase in the dignity and monumentality of capital cities, which now expanded
                    their role in manifesting national cultural identity. The extension and
                    protection of state boundaries through new developments in military engineering,
                    first apparent in <name type="place">France</name> under <name type="pname"
                        >Louis XIV</name>, rendered old city walls obsolete and made possible an
                    expansion of urban territory that paralleled the outward extension of the
                    garden's axes. The axial plan of <name type="place">Versailles</name> was
                    applied to parts of the layout and redevelopment of the city itself as well as
                    to the construction of many <name type="place">Versailles</name>-inspired
                    princely gardens.</p>
                <p>The landscape formulas of French classicism thus provided an international style
                    applicable to both the design of gardens and the building of cities, especially
                    capitals. Although French-inspired, this style was never completely severed from
                    its Italian roots, and the design influence of that country remained a potent
                    one. <name type="place">Italy</name>, with its heritage of antique architecture
                    and artifacts, was the principal destination of travelers on the Grand Tour in
                    the eighteenth century. Italian artists continued to find employment abroad in
                    the construction of palaces, gardens, and theaters as well as in the decoration
                    of public places with fountains and monuments. Indeed, it was in seventeenth-
                    and eighteenth-century city planning that the decorative motifs and theatrical
                    grandeur of the Italian Baroque style were combined with the geometries of
                    French authoritarian classicism to create a new international vocabulary of
                    urban design.</p>
                <p>Where there was sufficient wealth and centralized governmental control to
                    implement grand urban designs, the monumental cityscape of radiating axes
                    emerged, as in Karlsruhe, <name type="place">Germany</name>. Streets were no
                    longer conceived as residual spaces between buildings but instead were
                    consciously composed perspectives like those found in the theater. The city
                    itself became a giant stage for the pageantry of church and state, with
                    tree-lined streets punctuated by ceremonial arches. Some of these were temporary
                    constructions for special occasions; others were permanent commemorations.
                    Heroic sculptures formed the legendary <hi rend="italic">dramatis personae</hi>
                    of the urban scene. Along with columns and obelisks, they acted as focal points,
                    terminating vistas. In this fashion, the modern city was created, a city with
                    broad avenues suitable for regimented and rapid movement and with public places
                    enlivened by appropriate symbols of national and local culture.</p>

                    <p>The flow of ideas depends upon means of communication. Since antiquity,
                        direct observation of foreign scenes by travelers had carried innovations in
                        architecture and landscape design to new places. But beginning in the
                        sixteenth century, the growth of printing and the publication of books and
                        albums of engravings were responsible for the rapid spread of landscape
                        design concepts. Architects, sculptors, and hydraulic engineers still
                        responded to commissions from princes. But by the seventeenth and eighteenth
                        centuries, stylistic imitation became far easier because engravings served
                        not only as proud records of existing gardens but also as examples from
                        which prospective garden makers derived inspiration.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>First, a garden designer should make art yield to nature. <name
                                type="pname">Dezallier</name> did not mean by this what the English
                            later would mean, that a garden should appear unstudied, an integral
                            part of the larger natural scene, but rather that topographic and other
                            characteristics of the site should be considered carefully. Further,
                            ostentatious display of wealth through excessive ornament should be
                            abandoned in favor of simple steps, turf banks, ramps, natural arbors,
                            and hedges without trellises.</p>
                        <p>Nor did giving way to nature mean to <name type="pname">Dezallier</name>
                            abandoning geometrical design and eliminating topiary and other
                            regimented horticultural effects. Rather, for him it consisted of
                            eradicating all Renaissance intricacy, which now appeared as mere
                            fussiness, and clarifying and unifying all garden parts into a design
                            that respected both the natural site conditions and the patron's purse.
                            The French seventeenth-century garden had already chastened the
                            intricacies of Renaissance style, but it was still elaborately
                            ornamental and therefore exceedingly labor-intensive. Further<pb n="196"
                                /><pb n="196" type="orig"/>simplification was needed if it was to be
                            developed on a broad scale by aristocrats who did not possess the same
                            resources as royalty.</p>
                        <p>Second, according to <name type="pname">Dezallier</name>, a designer
                            should be careful never to cloud and darken gardens by making them dull
                            and gloomy with thickets and excessive ground cover. He found openness
                            desirable, especially around a building, inasmuch as a building needs

                            designer from making the garden <hi rend="italic">too</hi> open. He
                            recommended "contrariety and change," a happy balance between openness
                            and enclosure and, through the arrangement of sight lines, the
                            possibility of mystery and surprise. As a final cardinal rule, the
                            designer should manipulate the terrain and planting so as to conceal the
                            garden's boundaries, thus making it appear larger than its actual

                            important text verbatim for the instruction of his son, adding such
                            comments as he found necessary to make it relevant to climatic and

                        <p><name type="pname">Dezallier</name> wrote his book at the same time that
                                <name type="pname">Peter the Great</name> was founding his new
                            capital on the Neva and after the Holy Roman Empire had virtually
                            dissolved into many Germanic principalities. Court architecture was
                            experiencing its heyday, and there were many opportunities for applying
                                <name type="pname">Dezallier</name>'s landscape design precepts to
                            the construction of princely gardens. From one perspective <hi
                                rend="italic">La Th&#x00E9;orie et pratique du jardinage</hi> could
                            be seen as a codification of the principles of French
                            seventeenth-century landscape design at the very moment it was going out
                            of fashion, particularly in <name type="place">England</name> and soon
                            in <name type="place">France</name> itself. From another point of view,
                            however, it provided a useful and popular guide for those who wanted to
                            continue an important aspect of royal and aristocratic tradition almost
                            until the time of the French Revolution. Consequently, its results are
                            evident in many courtly gardens of the eighteenth century.</p>

                            display axial symmetry and other hallmarks of that style and include
                            numerous illustrations of garden ornament: treillage, fountains,

                            urns, trophies, sphinxes, herms, and more. His designs demonstrate how
                            aristocrats without royal resources at their command can achieve on a
                            modest scale effects similar to those at <name type="place"

                                >1773</date>), he praises the beauties to be found in views of
                            simple nature outside the garden bounds, and this, along with the Rococo
                            delicacy of his designs, indicates the burgeoning picturesque taste and
                            interest in pastoral themes.</p>

                            enlargement was additive, consisting of multiplied design units, or
                            garden rooms, rather than the integrated expansion of the garden's parts
                            to a new design scale. Like other designers from the Renaissance onward,

                        <p>An exuberant use of topiary and a native taste for genre subjects in
                            garden statuary characterized the many gardens that lined the banks of
                            suburban rivers and canals, providing weekend retreats for wealthy
                            merchants. These gardens afforded a twoway spectacle, since they
                            provided an unfolding scene of great interest to boat passengers and,
                            being furnished with pavilions and platforms overlooking the water,
                            offered their owners the pleasure of observing the water parade.</p>
                        <p>Although the Dutch appropriated the seventeenth-century French landscape
                            style, they reduced its grandeur and scale to suit the topography and
                            social expectations of the <name type="place">Netherlands</name>. We see
                            this in the now impeccably restored royal gardens of <name type="pname"
                                >Het Loo</name> in the eastern part of the country, the Veluwe, a
                            nonarable rolling landscape of low-growing brush and heather. This is
                            excellent country for the pursuit of game, and like <name type="place"
                                >Versailles</name>, <name type="pname">Het Loo</name> had its origin

                            had hunting rights to the Veluwe. Being a passionate sportsman, he
                            purchased the old castle of <name type="pname">Het Loo</name> with the
                            notion of building a more elegant and modern hunting establishment
                            elsewhere on the property.</p>
                        <p>Work began in <date when="1686">1686</date> under the supervision of the
                            Dutch architect <name type="pname">Jacob Roman</name> (<date when="1640"
                                >1640</date>&#x2013;<date when="1716">1716</date>) according to
                            designs thought to have been developed by the Academy of Architecture in
                                <name type="place">Paris</name>. Simultaneously, following the
                            revocation of the <date when="1685">1685</date> Edict of Nantes, the
                                <name type="pname">French Huguenot</name> designer <name
                                type="pname">Daniel Marot</name> (<date when="1661"

                            the principal designer of the new palace's interiors and gardens. This
                            fact accounts for the remarkable decorative unity between the two, with
                                <hi rend="italic">parterres de broderie</hi> echoing the arabesques
                            of molded ceilings, damask wall coverings, and iron grillwork. Between

                                type="place">England</name> in <date when="1689">1689</date>, their
                            gardens at <name type="pname">Het Loo</name> were extensively remodeled
                            by <name type="pname">Roman</name>, <name type="pname">Marot</name>, and

                                >1645</date>&#x2013;<date when="1708">1708</date>) to make them
                            suitable for entertaining state visitors when the joint sovereigns were
                            in residence in the <name type="place">Netherlands</name>.</p>
                        <p><name type="pname">Het Loo</name> displays its debt to <name type="place"
                                >Versailles</name> in its strong central axis with ornamental <hi
                                rend="italic">parterres</hi> symmetrically arranged along it and its
                            use of sculpture depicting classical subjects. But a closer look reveals
                            important differences, the most pronounced being its relative modesty,
                            intimacy of scale, sense of containment, and lack of transition between
                            art and nature. Where <name type="place">Versailles</name> virtually
                            explodes into the surrounding space, <name type="pname">Het Loo</name>
                            is strictly confined within its rectilinear enclosing walls like earlier
                            gardens of the Renaissance. The principal axis of the Lower Garden
                            extends beyond its boundary, but the twin arms of the curving colonnade
                            at the far end of the Upper Garden hold it in a firm embrace, thereby
                            vitiating its outward thrust (fig. 6.4). Nor has <name type="pname">Het
                                Loo</name> major transverse axes like those that open <name
                                type="place">Versailles</name> and Vaux-le-Vicomte to distant
                            prospects of rural countryside.</p>
                        <p>The Lower Garden near the palace is laid out in square compartments as in
                            a Renaissance garden, and this is also true of the King's Garden and
                            Queen's Garden on either side of it (figs. 6.5, 6.6). The French and
                            Dutch designers of <name type="pname">Het Loo</name> employed none of
                            the compensation for optical foreshortening one finds in <name
                                type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name>'s more sophisticated designs,
                            but they relied instead on the simpler geometries of an earlier period.
                            The pair of elaborate trellis arbors in the Queen's Garden are similar
                            to those of Renaissance gardens.</p>
                        <p>Besides the containment of Baroque ornamental elements within an enclosed
                            orthogonal framework reminiscent of Renaissance gardens, the most
                            significant difference between Dutch and French seventeenth-century
                            gardens lies in the role played by the canal in each. At <name
                                type="place">Versailles</name>, Chantilly, and elsewhere in <name
                                type="place">France</name>, the canals that help drain the land are
                            boldly scaled ornamental sheets of water used to create the principal
                            axes of the garden. In the <name type="place">Netherlands</name>,
                                where<pb n="199"/><pb n="199" type="orig"/>much of the country lies
                            below sea level, a ubiquitous functional canal system actually creates
                            much of the land. This system divides the Dutch landscape into
                            rectilinear units, so that canals form transportation arteries and also
                            mark property boundaries. Although purely ornamental canals were
                            constructed in some of the larger aristocratic gardens, these never
                            assumed the same importance as the broad water axes of French gardens.
                            At <name type="pname">Het Loo</name>, for instance, a pair of narrow
                            parallel canals divides the Upper Garden from the Lower Garden. These
                            are bordered by tree-lined promenades similar to those flanking the
                            canals of the countryside at large (fig. 6.7). In addition, because of
                            the scarcity of stone, architectural cascades such as those at <name
                                type="pname">Het Loo</name> were necessarily small in scale and the
                            exception rather than the rule (fig. 6.8).</p>

                            influence on the grounds that it symbolized monarchical absolutism. Nor
                            did the Counter-Reformation assert its Baroque splendor there as it did
                            in the European Catholic monarchies. The Renaissance literature of <name

                            is filled with images indicating the delight in nature of a people

                            pastoral images and scenes of sylvan revels, in which he mentions
                            numerous garden flowers and wildflowers. Bacon's essay "Of Gardens"
                                (<date when="1625">1625</date>) points the way toward both the
                            sensuous and the sensible in garden design. He lists all the flowers and
                            fruits that provide horticultural pleasure at various seasons of the
                            year, while disdaining knot gardens, which he characterizes as "toys"

                        <p>The pastoral literature of antiquity also played an important role in the
                            English version of the Renaissance dialectic between art and nature. The

                            ancient role models in Horace, who equated industrious husbandry with
                            republican virtue. The treatises of <name type="pname">Cato</name>,
                                <name type="pname">Varro</name>, and <name type="pname"
                                >Columella</name> were mined for practical information on
                            agricultural practices. For the gentry as well as the aristocracy, Pliny
                            the Younger's vision of <hi rend="italic">otium</hi>, or intellectually
                            productive exurban leisure, gave authority for the use of country houses
                            and gardens as places to demonstrate an interest in both new and
                            antiquarian knowledge.</p>

                            architecture shunned the absolutist overtones of the decoratively
                            refined French style and avoided the flamboyance of the exuberantly
                            ornamental Italian Baroque. This fact necessarily bore consequences for
                            landscape design. <name type="pname">Palladio</name>'s spare yet
                            Olympian style was vigorously revived by <name type="pname">Lord
                                Burlington</name>'s circle in the eighteenth century, when
                            architectural simplicity based upon ancient models gained even greater
                            political connotations than in the seventeenth. The Palladian style
                            helped place English landscape design upon an Italian foundation.
                            Further, the scale of English gardens remained closer to the relatively
                            intimate scale of Italian ones, and English topography provided more
                            opportunities for terracing in the Italian manner than did the plains of
                                <name type="place">France</name> or the lowlands of <name

                                divisions built around the central axis. Near the house this avenue
                                was flanked with square compartments of <hi rend="italic"
                                    >broderie</hi> overlooked by terraced walks. The middle section
                                contained a pair of arbor-bracketed groves (counterparts of the
                                French <hi rend="italic">berceaux</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                                    >bosquets</hi>) through which ran the Nadder. This stream was
                                not canalized, as would have been the case in a French garden, but
                                left to take a naturally irregular course traversing the symmetrical
                                groves. At the far end, in front of <name type="pname">Inigo

                        <p>The conflation of antiquarian interest with political values received a
                            further boost from travel. English aristocrats, already steeped in Latin
                            literature, formed strong direct associations with <name type="place"
                                >Italy</name> in the seventeenth century, when taking the Grand Tour
                            became practicable and fashionable. Thus, Italian garden influence
                            unmediated by that of <name type="place">France</name> played a greater
                            role in <name type="place">England</name> than on the Continent. Several
                            garden patrons attempted to recapture the idyllic spirit of the ancient
                            gardens of literature, as well as to imitate the poetic associations
                            found in Italian Renaissance gardens such as that of the Villa d'Este
                            through the use of statuary and grottoes in axial terraced
                            compositions.</p>
                        <p>These English nobles had a strong interest in scientific discovery. This
                            helps account for their fascination with the technological aspects of
                            garden hydrology as embodied in the ingenious automata&#x2014;<hi
                                rend="italic">giocchi d'acqua</hi>&#x2014;they had seen in Italian
                            gardens. A popular treatise by <name type="pname">Salomon de Caus</name>
                            (c. <date when="1577">1577</date>&#x2013;<date when="1626">1626</date>),
                                <hi rend="italic">Les Raisons des forces mouvantes</hi> (<date
                                when="1615">1615</date>), made the mechanics of automata familiar to
                            them. De Caus, a French Huguenot, had spent three years in <name
                                type="place">Italy</name> as a young man and, upon coming to <name

                            >1610</date>, introduced waterworks technology, terracing, and other
                            Italian gardening concepts. The English aristocratic mania for grotto
                            construction reflected a desire to emulate the grottoes of Italian
                            gardens and to establish the grotto's status as a place for scientific
                                study.<ref target="#CH6-n6"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold"
                                    >6</hi></hi></ref> Like the popular contemporary cabinets of
                            curiosities, these grottoes contained mineral and rock specimens as well
                            as collections of marine shells. They also served as laboratories for a
                            variety of experiments combining hydraulic machinery with natural
                            forces.</p>
                        <p>Garden prospects, including the scenery beyond the garden boundaries,
                            served the same function as perspective backdrops in the theater.
                            "Prospect" was an early and often-cited value in the development of the
                            English garden. By evoking ancient Roman forms and including real
                            British ruins&#x2014;mostly those of old monasteries, for which there
                            was much antiquarian enthusiasm&#x2014;these English gardens became
                            memory theaters and palimpsests of an ennobled past. Stages for social
                            intercourse and entertainment, they also became arenas of philosophical
                            contemplation and dramatic meditation upon national and family history.

                            gardens, the prospects contained elements of association with imperial

                            nephew of Salomon de Caus, collaborated with <name type="pname">Inigo

                                >Wilton House</name> (fig. 6.9). The visitor to <name type="pname"
                                >Wilton</name> today is scarcely aware of the buried splendor of the
                            original garden because it has been revised several times over the
                            years, most notably during the eighteenth century by the ninth Earl of
                            Pembroke. His Palladian bridge of <date when="1737">1737</date> and
                            towering cedars remain as relics of the eighteenth century, but they are
                            only the most visible parts of the palimpsest. There are the remains of
                            a splendid grotto (now a schoolhouse) and other scattered fragments of
                            the garden that was the pride of <name type="pname">Philip
                                Herbert</name>, fourth earl of Pembroke, in the <date when="1630"
                                >1630</date>s. Then, <name type="pname">Wilton</name>'s greatly
                            admired garden offered hospitality to the fashionable and learned
                            world.</p>
                        <p>The earl's gardeners laid out a symmetrical landscape along a central
                            axis leading to <name type="pname">Inigo Jones</name>'s porticoed
                            structure and beyond to a green amphitheater and wooded grove. There the
                            prospect culminated in a Roman-style triumphal arch topped by an
                            equestrian statue. Behind the loggia of <name type="pname"
                            >Jones</name>'s structure, which was decorated with marble bas-reliefs
                            and may have served as a banqueting chamber, and beneath the terrace
                            connecting the garden with the wooded slope beyond, was an extraordinary
                            three-chambered grotto, a particular source of <name type="pname"
                                >Wilton</name>'s fame.</p>
                        <p>Within it, automata, mechanically propelled waterworks, delighted the
                            earl's guests. <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name>'s influence
                            later demystified grottoes and made such mechanical marvels as the ones

                            Puritan times, agricultural prosperity was encouraged, but ornamental
                            horticulture was not. Several old gardens were intentionally destroyed,

                        <p>Although their many intricately designed sections were planned
                            symmetrically, these gardens lack the cadenced thrust of strong
                            principal axes and hence the controlling organization and compositional
                            unity found in contemporary French examples (fig. 6.11). Indeed, the
                            transverse axes in these gardens often gain as much as or more
                            importance than the central one. They are Dutch-influenced, and
                            relatively anti-authoritarian in spirit. Many were built following the
                            Glorious Revolution of <date when="1688">1688</date> and during the

                            characteristically British sense that reticence and understatement are
                            nobler attributes of the great and wealthy than ostentatious
                            display.</p>
                        <p>Dutch influence in British garden design, with its inference of decorous
                            bourgeois prosperity, was carried to some parts of colonial <name
                                type="place">America</name>, notably <name type="place"

                            topiary and canals as garden features. These canals were not employed in
                            the French manner as extensions of the principal axis; instead, as in
                            the <name type="place">Netherlands</name>, designers placed independent
                            bodies of water at one side of the garden, often with one or more
                            attendant pavilions, as at Westbury Court, begun at the end of the

                            many of the gardens surrounding the great country seats depicted in the

                        <p>Today the enormous overgrown yews in the Great Fountain Garden at Hampton

                            clipped, serve as reminders of the disfavor into which the Anglo-Dutch
                            garden fell in the eighteenth century. By contrast, within the
                            principalities of <name type="place">Germany</name>, where aristocratic
                            authoritarianism still prevailed, the classical splendor of <name

                            courtly gardens and urban planning, although, at least initially, some
                            Italian currents ran northward as well.</p>

                            Renaissance gardens to be observed and imitated in such prosperous
                            cities as <name type="place">Augsburg</name>, <name type="place"
                                >Nuremberg</name>, and <name type="place">Frankfurt</name> were
                            those of <name type="place">Italy</name>, German gardens did not readily
                            incorporate the pagan images and erotically charged atmosphere of
                            Italian models until the libertine atmosphere of the eighteenth century
                            permitted such license. The vigorous new garden art that flourished in
                                <name type="place">Germany</name> combined French and Dutch
                            influences with Italian ones. Not surprisingly in a country of so many
                            regional power centers, these influences were never amalgamated into a
                            distinctive national style. The many Renaissance gardens that were laid
                            out beside town houses, the residences of archbishops, and the castles
                            of princes were enclosed, compartmentalized rectangular spaces, axially
                            disconnected from the edifices to which they were attached, with

                        <p>After the Thirty Years' War ended, garden patrons looked almost entirely
                            to <name type="place">France</name> for inspiration, as that country was
                            increasingly the center of economic energy and artistic imagination.
                            German princes imported gardeners and fountain engineers along with
                            design theories as they modified French style to suit their tastes.
                            Dutch influence was also present, particularly in <name type="pname"
                                >Lower Saxony</name> at <name type="place">Hanover</name>, where

                        <p>In the politically unstable atmosphere of seventeenth-century <name
                                type="place">Germany</name>, authority was fragile and transient,
                            and the princely landscape was often constructed as a symbolic
                            expression of absolutist power, an assertion of control over potentially
                            fractious municipalities. Karlsruhe, the creation in <date when="1715"

                            Baden-Durlach, makes this statement with its spiderweb of avenues
                            radiating outward from the palace (fig. 6.16). Their indeterminate
                            length made the entire surrounding countryside appear subservient to the
                            margrave.</p>

                            architecture, which is strongly indebted to the Italian Baroque style of
                            Francesco Borromini, an underlying Austrian anti-French sentiment is
                            perhaps more evident. Other nobles also built luxurious palaces and

                            kilometers) from the center of the city into a palace and grounds that
                            would symbolize in its grandeur and magnificence not only Hapsburg
                            imperial power, but also the triumph of the Christian West over Ottoman
                            rule. The original scheme, determinedly Italian rather than French,
                            placed the palace like a beacon on a hill. This plan was too costly and
                            impractical, however, even for an imperial purse, and a revised design
                            located it on the plain below (fig. 6.18).</p>

                            taste of the age, the architect added an obelisk and an artificial ruin

                            constructed the Neptune pool, and, at the end of the long axis on top,
                            he placed a handsome <hi rend="italic">gloriette</hi>, a neoclassical

                                >1687</date>&#x2013;<date when="1745">1745</date>) to <name
                                type="place">Paris</name> to study the principles of French
                            landscape design. But it was not only the lessons of <name type="pname"
                                >Le N&#x00F4;tre</name> that Effner carried home from abroad; he
                            also imbibed the more relaxed spirit of the Rococo, the lighthearted,
                            intimately scaled ornamental style that originated in <name type="place"
                                >France</name> in the early eighteenth century. In essence, the
                            Rococo style constitutes a last phase of the Baroque, and it is not as
                            robust in its forms or as sober in its iconography as the Baroque.
                            Rococo designers especially prized elegant curvaceousness and delicacy
                            of detail. They put a premium on naturalistic floral and rustic forms as
                            well on the creation in gardens of highly picturesque rustic scenery.
                            They extended the long popularity of the grotto, often incorporating
                            into their plans <hi rend="italic">rocaille</hi>, the amorphous,
                            frequently shell-encrusted, artificial rockwork suggestive of coral
                            reefs and caves.</p>
                        <p>In Rococo design, Baroque forms have been playfully recast to reflect the
                            mores of the <hi rend="italic">ancien r&#x00E9;gime</hi>, which was
                            bored with the grandeur of authoritarian monarchy, even though most
                            aristocrats still adhered to this collapsing political system. Because
                            of increased Western contact with <name type="place">China</name> and a
                            growing enthusiasm for the decorative arts of that country among
                            European aristocrats, the Rococo style also embodies elements of <hi
                                rend="italic">chinoiserie</hi>, the decorative reinterpretation of
                            Chinese forms that first appeared in the seventeenth century and assumed
                            its full proportions in the eighteenth century, when pagodas, "Chinese"
                            bridges, and tea pavilions became popular features in Western gardens.
                            Rococo designers put a premium on exoticism in general, incorporating
                            into their landscape plans such ornamental structures as "Egyptian
                            pyramids" and "Turkish tents," festively painted wooden pavilions built
                            in imitation of the silk caravan tents of Islamic royalty.</p>

                            It was surrounded by a garden that combined the French and Italian
                            influences. Although this garden has now vanished, the one built

                            Esterh&#x00E1;zy, has been preserved and restored. Esterh&#x00E1;za
                            exemplifies the courtly style that prevailed throughout eastern <name

                            its height (fig. 6.24). The layout of the <hi rend="italic"
                                >parterre</hi> garden, with its floweredged beds, sandstone urns,
                            statuary, and fountains, was based upon an engraving in <hi

                            Garden temples, a pair of cascades, and a triumphal arch ornamented the
                                <hi rend="italic">bosquets</hi> surrounding this garden. A Chinese

                            addition, Esterh&#x00E1;za boasted an opera house, a music building, and
                            a puppet theater. Upon the historic occasion of the empress's visit, the
                            court composer, <name type="pname">Franz Joseph Haydn</name>, created
                            two operas to entertain the royal guest. Beyond the ornamental gardens
                            lay a deer park with crisscrossing <hi rend="italic">all&#x00E9;es</hi>
                            and also a boar park with avenues radiating from a <hi rend="italic"

                        <p>Although firmly reasserting European stylistic dominance,
                            eighteenth-century Hungarian gardens maintained some of the
                            horticultural elements bequeathed to them by the earlier period of the
                            country's Turkish occupation. These included citrus plants,
                            pomegranates, tulips, and other exotic species. The gardens of the
                            nobility also became showcases for additional non-native species derived
                            from botanical exploration, such as chestnut, catalpa, locust, and
                            hornbeam trees. Like the Rococo follies nearby, exotic plants were
                            prestigious symbols of the garden owners' cosmopolitan perspective and
                            scientific interest.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, there was a reaction throughout <name type="place"
                                >Europe</name> to the kind of landscapes that perpetuated an
                            increasingly discredited authoritarian taste. As we shall see, beginning
                            in the first third of the eighteenth century, the English began to
                            produce gardens that were less regular and more naturalistic than those
                            descended from <name type="place">Versailles</name> and derived from the
                            Dutch influence under <name type="pname">William</name> and <name
                                type="pname">Mary</name>. As <name type="place">England</name>'s
                            power as a nation rose, English garden design influenced Continental
                            taste to an increasing degree. Near the end of the eighteenth century,
                            many European princes and other aristocrats adopted the style known as
                                <hi rend="italic">jardin anglais</hi>&#x2014;and also as <hi
                                rend="italic">jardin anglo-chinois</hi>&#x2014;for their
                            garden-building projects. Further, many of their descendants tore out
                            the garden designs they had inherited when the <hi rend="italic">jardin
                                anglais</hi> reached the height of fashion in the nineteenth
                            century. The popularity of the new English landscape style in the latter
                            part of the eighteenth century helps explain why the Rococo effects of
                            this period, such as <hi rend="italic">chinoiserie</hi>, were employed
                            equally in both geometrically formal gardens and informal ones and also
                            why the naturalization of exotic plants went on at the same time in the
                            two kinds of landscape. By turning Baroque forms into whimsy, Rococo
                            ornament became suitable within settings that relied on a naturalistic
                            aesthetic as well as within those that still retained classical design
                            principles of axiality and symmetry. Similarly, exotic plants
                            complemented the penchant for the bizarre found in French Rococo
                            gardens, but these could be also naturalized within a less contrived
                            "English" landscape.</p>

                            slight, allowing a vigorous Iberian version of Baroque and Rococo garden

                        <p>The Portuguese conquerors who garnered imperial wealth from the <name

                            built churches, palaces, and monasteries. They also ornamented their
                            small, hilly country with many beautiful gardens that creatively
                            amalgamated several foreign influences. Because of the country's
                            favorable climate, they were able to naturalize many exotic plant
                            species collected by <name type="pname">Jesuit</name> missionaries from
                            abroad. The marquess of Pombal established a botanical garden at
                            Coimbra, the seat of an important Portuguese university, in <date
                                when="1772">1772</date>, and a botanical garden was set up at the
                            same time in Lisbon.</p>
                        <p>The Portuguese were the heirs of Islamic <name type="place">Spain</name>.
                            Glazed tiles&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">azulejos</hi>&#x2014;painted with
                            arabesque and geometric designs in tones of yellow, blue, and green, had
                            long been manufactured there, and by the fifteenth century, these were
                            being imported to <name type="place">Portugal</name> where they were
                            applied to many kinds of walls and floors, including those found in
                            several gardens.</p>
                        <p>The Portuguese established their own tile factories as the craft waned in
                                <name type="place">Spain</name>. They expanded their palette of
                            colors and substituted pictorial motifs for the abstract ones required
                            by Islam. At the same time, they devised composite images by fitting
                            together several square tiles. As Baroque and Rococo motifs gained
                            artistic currency, the Portuguese became the undisputed masters of tile
                            design, creating numerous exuberant patterns. This tilework constitutes
                            an important element in their virtuosic blending of Islamic, Spanish,
                            Italian, and French influences into an original national landscape style
                            (figs. 6.31, 6.32).</p>
                        <p>Water tanks, an Islamic legacy, are particularly important features in
                            Portuguese gardens. In sum<pb n="211"/><pb n="211" type="orig"/>mer
                            droughts, they ensured both the residential water supply and the
                            irrigation of the garden's plants. They were usually placed in a fairly
                            elevated position to allow the water to be distributed by force of
                            gravity. Here the reflectivity of both water and tile combine with the
                            designer's imagination to make these utilitarian structures into
                            delightfully decorative garden features, as at the Quinta da Balcalhoa
                            and the Pal&#x00E1;cio dos Marqueses de Fronteira (figs. 6.33,
                            6.34).</p>
                        <p>Replete with ornament and sculpture, seventeenth- and eighteenth-century
                            Portuguese gardens are nevertheless conservative in their overall
                            design. Although some box parterres were laid out in <hi rend="italic"
                                >broderie</hi> designs, the design of others, such as that at the
                            Pal&#x00E1;cio Fronteira, where there is an intricate maze, harks back
                            stylistically to the Renaissance. Decorative shellwork similar to that
                            found in Italian Mannerist grottoes is abundant here. Even more
                            important, these Portuguese gardens are spatially contained; they are
                            old-fashioned for their day in having walls and also in their absence of
                            strong axial organization. Garden designers adapted their schemes to
                            existing topography and did not practice extensive regrading, as was the
                            case in contemporary gardens elsewhere in <name type="place"
                                >Europe</name>. Their loggia terraces were built for viewing <hi
                                rend="italic">parterre</hi> designs from above, but otherwise they
                            have no connection with the plan of the garden. Although
                            backward-looking in these ways, the gardens that were built in <name
                                type="place">Portugal</name> at this time are highly original. In
                            their exuberant exploitation of the design opportunities inherent in a
                            regional commodity&#x2014;glazed tiles&#x2014;the Portuguese confidently
                            forged their own distinctive landscape idiom.</p>

                        <p>Although many notable gardens were produced by the fusion in the
                            eighteenth century of the predominant French influence with that of
                            other traditions, of even greater consequence was the more far-reaching
                            and long-lasting effect of landscape design from this era on the
                            planning of cities. Increasingly, as monarchical authority sought to
                            glorify itself on a public scale, not just the royal demesne but the
                            entire capital city became the focus of monumental urbanism. The idea
                            that cities could be planned according to Baroque and French
                            seventeenth-century design principles was suited, moreover, to the
                            rising tide of nationalism and the desire to find an urban form that was
                            expressive of the power of the state.</p>

                    <p>By the beginning of the eighteenth century, the appearance of cityscapes owed
                        much to the lessons landscape design professionals had learned in the
                        seventeenth century. Axial extension, <hi rend="italic">all&#x00E9;es</hi>

                        content&#x2014;these are, as we have seen, the basic ingredients of <name
                            type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name>'s garden style. <name type="pname"
                            >Le N&#x00F4;tre</name> had conceived the plan for the town of <name
                            type="place">Versailles</name> as integral with that of the gardens of
                        the palace, and <name type="pname">Margrave Karl Wilhelm</name> had treated
                        town and park in a similar fashion at Karlsruhe (see fig. 6.16). But royal
                        patronage was not strictly necessary for the further development of this
                        style of urbanism. Throughout the seventeenth century, with the rise of the
                        middle class, cities gained increasing autonomy and became more than court
                        appendages, episcopal seats, or mere trading centers. National governments
                        and municipal corporations employed architects, engineers, and artists to
                        revise and extend their layouts and to embellish them in a manner that
                        promoted state and civic pride.</p>
                    <p>The resulting form of urbanism, which has remained a valid paradigm for
                        planners down to modern times, was thus concomitant with the growth of
                        nation-states and the status of the city as an expression of the wealth and
                        virtue of its citizenry. The premise of infinitely extensible axes that is
                        central to this manner of design foreshadowed the disappearance of city
                        walls as nations came into<pb n="213"/><pb n="213" type="orig"/>existence
                        and city-states ceased to function as independent and autonomous political
                        units. In addition, with the seventeenth-century technical invention of
                        spring suspension and the introduction of plate-glass windows, carriage
                        travel became a sociable pastime as well as a comparatively efficient means
                        of locomotion, and this fact had obvious consequences for the scale of
                        streets and the design of cities.</p>

                            modern city occurred when military engineers developed a new system of
                            defense employing projecting bastions instead of battlements. With their
                            "ears" and pointed triangular "demi-lunes," these strategic
                            constructions were built to withstand cannon siege while allowing the
                            defending artillery maximum protection as they fired back along a series
                            of intersecting diagonal sight lines. In plan, they form starburst
                            patterns. Like the gardens of <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name>,
                            they thrust outward, metaphorically invading space.<ref target="#CH6-n9"

                            "organic" approach to urbanism characteristic of many older cities and
                            the subordination of everyday life to a conceptual order based on
                            symbolical intent as well as practical considerations. Even where the
                            perennially useful grid was employed, the underlying symbolism of the
                            Baroque cityscape, which pressed Renaissance humanism into the service
                            of proclaiming princely power, demanded its ruthless interruption by
                            radials emanating like the rays of the sun from the court or seat of
                            government. It is because of its indifference to the requirements of the
                            daily lives of ordinary individuals that urban historians&#x2014;<name

                            kind of authoritarian planning harshly. But its compensatory offering
                            was theatricality and a new vision of the dignity of public space and
                            public life in which a reciprocity of sight lines between civic
                            institutions symbolically expressed the political and cultural
                            aspirations of the society.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">rond-point</hi> with its long vistas along the
                            straight diagonals of the hunting park provided a new model for radial
                            thoroughfares emanating from a circle in a star pattern, facilitating
                            both the movement of ordinary traffic and military troops in an
                            emergency, while considerably increasing the dynamism and drama of city
                            space. The tree-lined <hi rend="italic">all&#x00E9;es</hi> found in
                            French gardens provided a model for street tree planting. They are the
                            progenitors not only of broad avenues for pleasant strolling, but also
                            of tree-lined processional and parade routes like the Champs
                            &#x00C9;lys&#x00E9;es in <name type="place">Paris</name> and <name

                            fountains, monuments, and sculptures that serve as place fixers for
                            squares and circles that punctuate their length and provide a cadence to
                            the movement along them, these ceremonial axes dramatize the city and
                            articulate messages of civic pride and national power.</p>
                        <p>Urban squares were intentionally designed as stages for public life and
                            heroic commemoration. Even without the foci of fountains and monuments,
                            these architecturally conceived spaces conveyed a powerful sense of
                            place and became elements of the imagery that gave each city its
                            individual character in the minds of its citizens and visitors. In
                            addition, the Baroque cityscape was one in which heights were
                            dramatized; the lofty church or palace, the proud hilltop monument, the
                            urban cascade, and the grand stairway provided urban distinction and
                            sense of place.</p>
                        <p>The Baroque cityscape married the appreciation of real and symbolic order
                            characteristic of French classicism to the instinct for dramatic siting
                            and theatrical effects found in Italian landscape design. The combined
                            genius of <name type="pname">Michelangelo</name>, <name type="pname"
                                >Bernini</name>, and <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name>
                            helped shape a new urban form that inspired plans for the layout of
                            cities on a grand scale suitable to new modes of transportation. More
                            orderly than any plans since the days of the Roman Empire, these also
                            envisioned new standards of public sanitation and safety as well as new
                            standards of public recreation and entertainment.</p>

                            we examined in Chapter Four. He brought to the secular imagery of the

                            in his commissions for the Counter-Reformation Church. In addition to

                            gods. These figures are not self-contained and languidly at rest like
                            the river gods of antiquity, but actively twist and gesture like actors

                        <p>From today's vantage point, it is sometimes difficult to remember that
                            even with the construction of new streets and significant works of
                            architecture, seventeenth-century cities were far more rural in
                            character than ours. Though some streets were paved, many were not, and
                            we see with surprise in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century prints of
                                <name type="place">Rome</name> the still-rough, undressed character
                            of the surrounding ground plane and the quasi-rustic character of the
                            public life within the spaces that envelop these architectural and
                            sculptural masterpieces. Nevertheless, at the beginning of the
                            seventeenth century, <name type="place">Rome</name> was the most
                            sophisticated and urbane city in the Western world. With its numerous
                            ruins as testaments of its historical greatness, it was a place in which
                            one felt the poetics of the collapsed centuries. Added to this was the
                            festive air of papal pomp and worldly pleasure made manifest in stone.
                            These provided ample basis for <name type="place">Rome</name>'s growing

                            for urban scenography, <name type="place">Rome</name> provided a
                            vocabulary of forms for cityscapes elsewhere. It also initiated the
                            characteristically Baroque concept of dynamic movement through space, an
                            idea that had its roots in the Mannerists' concern with perspective and
                            that now made a sensual experience of the eye's journey through space.
                            Baroque spatial organization was not merely horizontal; the
                            architectural embellishment of heights with buildings, monuments, and
                            grand stairs of ascent gave a vertical dimension to movement. The
                            animated movement of water rising and falling into Roman fountains and,
                            in addition, the gestural sculpture that ornamented them added further
                            spatial drama to the urban scene.</p>
                        <p>Essentially plastic in their formal orientation and theatrical in their
                            approach, Roman designers developed an urbanism that thrived on
                            incident, creating a street network of interrelated points of interest
                            rather than, as in <name type="place">France</name>, an exploration of
                            the possibilities of space for its own sake. Roman urbanism contained a
                            celebratory message, one that sought to dazzle the senses and awe the
                            mind with the reaffirmed glory of the Catholic Church and the
                            resurrected splendor of the imperial past. French urbanists, on the
                            other hand, with less emotional exuberance, greater reliance on
                            intellect and reason, and a gift for centralized administration,
                            dramatized the power of the modern state. The manifestation of this
                            power in an overall plan for <name type="place">Paris</name> in which
                                <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name>'s seemingly infinite axes
                            were applied on a civic scale would, given <name type="pname">Louis

                            Chapter Ten). As we saw in Chapter Four, the groundwork for that
                            urbanistic feat had already been laid even before the time of <name

                            >Italy</name>, the invention of the spring-suspension carriage had made
                            straight avenue circulation a new priority in urban design. In <date
                                when="1616">1616</date>, in imitation of the Corso on the outskirts
                            of her native Florence, <name type="pname">Henry IV</name>'s widow,
                            Marie de M&#x00E9;dicis, had the Coursla-Reine laid out for carriage
                            promenaders on the outskirts of the city along the banks of the Seine to
                            the west of the Tuileries (fig. 6.37). Quadruple rows of elms created
                            three avenues almost a mile in length, bringing not only the amenity of
                            the tree-lined street to <name type="place">Paris</name>, but also the
                            socialization of urban space. People had discovered, along with the
                            visual and physical enjoyment of movement itself, the theatrical
                                possi<pb n="215"/><pb n="215" type="orig"/>bilities of street life
                            with its daily spectacle of carriages and promenaders. Bewigged and
                            dressed in silks and lace, the socially ambitious saw themselves as
                            protagonists in the diurnal drama of meeting and greeting one another in
                            public. The Cours-la-Reine was soon thronged with carriages, one more
                            opulently appointed than the next, and its popularity was so great that
                            on the opposite side of town the <name type="pname">Cours
                                St.Antoine</name> was inaugurated on the rue <name type="pname"
                                >St.-Antoine</name>, the main ceremonial entry to <name type="place"
                                >Paris</name> from the east along the road from Vincennes. Here the
                            trees were planted to form twin all&#x00E9;es for promenading with a
                            broad carriage drive in between. To extend it eastward, the Cours de
                            Vincennes was built in the <date when="1660">1660</date>s.</p>
                        <p>The most important <hi rend="italic">cours</hi> of all was that initiated
                            by <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name> around <date when="1670"
                                >1670</date> when the axis of the Tuileries, called the Grand Cours,
                            was extended approximately a mile into the open countryside to the
                            &#x00C9;toile, as the <hi rend="italic">rond-point</hi> with its
                            starburst of radiating avenues is called. Between this axis and the
                            Cours-laReine beside the Seine, royal gardeners planted a stretch of
                            ground as a quincunx&#x2014;a regular arrangement of trees set in a
                            pattern composed of multiple units of five, in which four trees comprise
                            the angles of a square or rectangle, while the fifth serves to mark its
                            center. The poetic name for this grove was Champs &#x00C9;lys&#x00E9;es,
                            meaning the Elysian Fields. Another short axis connected the
                            Cours-la-Reine with the wide, treebordered carriage drive and promenade
                            of the Grand Cours. Today the Grand Cours bears the name of the old
                            grove beside it and is known as the Champs &#x00C9;lys&#x00E9;es. Since
                                <name type="pname">Napoleon</name> located his Arc de Triomphe in
                            the center of <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name>'s &#x00C9;toile,
                                <name type="place">Paris</name> has effectively faced west instead
                            of east toward Vincennes, and while the recreational nature of the Grand
                            Cours still lingers in the recently restored promenades and caf&#x00E9;s
                            lining the Champs &#x00C9;lys&#x00E9;es, the route has also served for
                            the last two hundred years as the city's principal ceremonial
                            thoroughfare.</p>
                        <p>Under <name type="pname">Louis XIV</name>, military engineers began
                            construction of a new system of <hi rend="italic">boulevarts</hi>
                            (bastions), and from the beginning these were designed to form a green
                            girdle of wide tree-lined carriage drives and promenades, the forerunner
                            of the circumferential modern boulevards built at grade level when the
                                <hi rend="italic">boulevart</hi> walls were at last removed. Since
                            the construction of these new bastions stretched well into the
                            eighteenth century, it became increasingly apparent that even their
                            modest pretence at defense was both useless and unnecessary, and the
                            city began to spread freely, incorporating into itself the surrounding
                                <hi rend="italic">faubourgs</hi>. Moreover, it probably became
                            apparent to government authorities that, although they served as a
                            convenient customs barrier and a good lookout for patrolling sentinels
                            posted to keep the peace, the walls might even assist rebellion and mob
                            usurpation of power within <name type="place">Paris</name> if a
                            revolutionary force gained control of them. Thus the primary function of
                            the boulevards, or <hi rend="italic">remparts</hi>, as they continued to
                            be called, was one of recreational circulation, and cafes and other
                            places of entertainment eventually sprang up along the more frequented
                            ones such as the popular Boulevard du Nord.</p>

                            looked like today had <name type="pname">Louis XIV</name> chosen to

                            reign: the Place des Victoires (<date when="1682"
                                >1682</date>&#x2013;<date when="1687">87</date>) and the Place <name

                            the Place Vend&#x00F4;me). Both were built by <name type="pname">Jules
                                Hardouin-Mansart</name>, the court architect, as squares defined by
                            uniform architectural facades, spaces in which to place a statue of the
                            king. Of greater consequence to the welfare of the city's population,
                                <name type="pname">Colbert</name> had fifteen new public fountains
                            built and torch lamps installed for nighttime illumination.
                            Nevertheless, not having the king's firm backing for comprehensive urban
                            planning, he left <name type="place">Paris</name> a city better known
                            abroad for its offal-filled streets than for this modicum of public
                            health and security or its isolated architectural gems and new rampart
                            boulevards.</p>

                            eighteenth-century <name type="place">Paris</name> with the construction

                                >France</name>. These framed the square; its centerpiece was a

                        <p>The fixity of human settlement is such that, unless a powerful
                            authoritarian will can exert control, patterns of land occupancy
                            generally resist radical alteration. Even when opportunities to rebuild
                            anew arise after such calamities as war and fire, in their efforts to
                            reestablish property ownership and a sense of historical continuity and
                            place, people prefer old circulation patterns and building lot
                            configurations to new ones, although the new ones may be considerably
                            more convenient and attractive. In such dire circumstances, people
                            become instinctive preservationists. The urbanistic history of
                            seventeenth-century <name type="place">London</name> proves the
                            point.</p>

                                >1666</date> destroyed almost 400 acres within its walls and an
                            additional 60 outside, leaving a huge semicircle of smoldering ruins. In
                            addition to eighty-seven parish churches and many other public buildings
                            including those housing the entire financial and mercantile districts,
                            13,200 houses went up in flames leaving nearly a quarter million people
                                homeless.<ref target="#CH6-n12"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold"

                            fire, <name type="pname">Christopher Wren</name>, <name type="pname"
                                >John Evelyn</name>, and others presented plans that incorporated
                            the lessons of both <name type="place">Versailles</name> and <name

                            plan, but piecemeal over the next fifty years along the lines of its old
                            streets and lanes.</p>
                        <p>The walls of <name type="place">London</name>, like those of <name
                                type="place">Paris</name>, gradually fell into disuse, and, with the
                            city's continued residential growth as its population climbed to
                            overtake that of any European city, a number of residential squares were
                            laid out by developers. In Westminster and the West End, as well as in
                            Bloomsbury east of those areas, leaseholds to great mansions and their
                            gardens were sold to building developers, but the landowners' names and
                            titles were commemorated in the new streets and squares that took their
                            place. The notion of the symmetrical planned square with architecturally
                            unified building facades and a groundfloor arcade had been borrowed from
                                <name type="place">Italy</name> by <name type="pname">Inigo
                                Jones</name> (<date when="1573">1573</date>&#x2013;<date when="1652"
                                >1652</date>) when he built Covent Garden as a speculation for the
                            fourth earl of Bedford in <date when="1639">1639</date> (fig. 6.39).
                            Specifically, the great neo-Palladian architect had modeled his plan for
                            Covent Garden on that of the Piazza d'Arme built by the Medici dukes in
                            the fortress and port town of Livorno at the end of the sixteenth
                            century, a symmetrical square of arcaded buildings (fig. 6.40).<ref
                                target="#CH6-n13"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">13</hi></hi></ref>
                            Initially an address for the well-born, Covent Garden became a market
                            square in <date when="1671">1671</date> and,<pb n="217"/><pb n="217"

                            district that flourished there in the eighteenth century.</p>
                        <p>At the same time that Covent Garden Piazza (as it was first called) was
                            being built, the layout of another group of speculative houses around
                                <name type="pname">Lincoln'</name>s Inn Fields was under way. In the
                            early <date when="1660">1660</date>s at Bloomsbury Square, the fourth
                            earl of Southampton set the pattern of residential development that
                            became common in <name type="place">London</name> after the Great Fire
                            as land-owning aristocrats realized the profits to be made by turning
                            landlord. Bloomsbury Square lots varied in size, and leases specified
                            only that houses be reasonably large and of a suitably dignified
                            character. From this point forward, the squares of <name type="place"
                                >London</name> assumed a more heterogeneous, less authoritarian
                            appearance than their Continental counterparts. They were greener, too,
                            for, whereas Parisian squares had been planned as public spaces, in
                                <name type="place">London</name>, where there was no tradition of
                            their public use as promenades or arenas for spectacles, they were often
                            designed as fenced and locked gardens, with keys provided only to those
                            whose houses fronted upon them. This difference between the squares of
                                <name type="place">Paris</name> and <name type="place">London</name>
                            was perpetuated in the nineteenth century when <name type="pname">Baron
                                Haussmann</name>, <name type="pname">Louis-Napol&#x00E9;on</name>'s
                            Prefect of the Seine, built several new ones as landscaped islands
                            within <name type="place">Paris</name>'s improved circulation system,
                            whereas those of <name type="place">London</name> continued to be
                            planted as quasi-private gardens for adjacent residents.</p>
                        <p>In the busy building years following the Great Fire, many of the <name
                                type="place">London</name> squares that today contribute greatly to
                            the city's green and pleasant character took shape. With the development
                            of elegant Grosvenor Square between <date when="1725">1725</date> and
                                <date when="1731">1731</date>, <name type="place">London</name>'s
                            largest square with the exception of <name type="pname">Lincoln</name>'s
                            Inn Fields, Mayfair became the district of choice for many titled people
                            (fig. 6.41). On the neighboring estate to the east, <name type="place"
                                >Berkeley</name> Square continued the now-familiar pattern of
                            Georgian town houses facing a common green. With the exception of Covent
                            Garden, which early assumed its character as a public space, most of
                            these greens remained discreetly sequestered behind iron palings and off
                            limits to passersby. It was not until <date when="1832">1832</date> with
                            the creation of Trafalgar Square, where ten years later the naval
                            victory of <name type="pname">Lord Nelson</name> was memorialized with a
                            145-foot- (44-meter-) high column, that <name type="place">London</name>
                            received a nonresidential public square and urban landmark similar in

                        <p>Seventeenth-century <name type="place">London</name> offered other places
                            in which the gregarious could congregate. The same cultural forces that
                            were at work in <name type="place">Paris</name> and elsewhere were at
                            work in <name type="place">London</name>, too, creating a new element of
                            the population attached to the court yet flourishing with growing
                            independence from it. With increased wealth derived from manufacturing
                            and trade and the first wave of riches from overseas colonies, "society"
                            had come into being. The growth of cities during this period was
                            accompanied by a change in their character. They no longer functioned
                            simply as fortified centers of production, exchange, and religious
                            celebration. Cities in the seventeenth century, especially capital
                            cities like <name type="place">London</name> and <name type="place"
                                >Paris</name>, became places of pleasure and, to a greater degree
                            than was true of cities since antiquity, places where ideas as well as
                            goods were traded, the wombs of intellectual discovery and ideology. The
                            need of the new leisure class for entertainment as well as for
                            intellectual and social stimulation brought into being new urban forms:
                            the coffeehouse and its French variant the caf&#x00E9;, as well as the
                            theater and the promenade.</p>

                            broad walk at the southern end of the park is still called. In the
                            eighteenth century, Queen Caroline, the wife of <name type="pname"
                                >George II</name>, had the Queen's Walk built along its less public
                            eastern border, for by that time the park had become crowded with
                            Londoners enjoying themselves as they strolled along its crisscrossing
                            web of gravel paths set amid green grass. During its long history as an
                            urban public space, Green Park also served as a place for military
                            parades, public celebrations, duels, and in the nineteenth century,
                            numerous hotair balloon ascents.</p>

                            fashion (fig. 6.43). The park was enclosed by a brick wall and the Ring,
                            first called the Tour, was laid out by the king as a carriage promenade
                            for the <hi rend="italic">beau monde</hi>. <name type="pname">Rotten

                            turned the Broad Walk into a fashionable promenade running from north to
                            south in front of the palace.</p>
                        <p><name type="place">London</name>, then, was throughout the seventeenth
                            and eighteenth centuries a city growing piecemeal, district by district,
                            as the properties of several noble families who had the good fortune to
                            own land were turned into profitable real-estate speculations. It
                            therefore had no sense of overall order based upon a comprehensive plan.
                            Its character is limned by historical circumstance rather than by a
                            grand design. As will become apparent from an examination of the history
                            of <name type="place">St. Petersburg</name>, bold urban design visions
                            stand a greater chance of realization where there is no preexisting

                            in the nineteenth century, it was developed into an arcaded shopping

                        <p>In building <name type="place">St. Petersburg</name>, <name type="pname"
                                >Peter the Great</name> had envisioned not only a city with the

                            commercial port. He had especially admired the Dutch city's new series
                            of concentric canals bordered by tree-lined promenades and unbroken rows
                            of town houses, and he had left orders in <date when="1716">1716</date>

                            too small to be navigable. They were therefore filled in, and this part
                            of the city acquired instead a uniform grid of streets.</p>
                        <p>As <name type="place">St. Petersburg</name> became more cosmopolitan, the

                            for this northern capital with its whirl of social life centered upon
                            the court and the imperial family. A number of Italian architects were
                            commissioned to work alongside the Russian architects to build palaces

                        <p>By the nineteenth century, <name type="place">St. Petersburg</name> had
                            become a pleasure capital for the rich. With its university and
                            Academies of Arts and Sciences, its daily spectacle of carriages and
                            shoppers along Nevsky Prospekt, its theaters and ballet, its German
                            private schools and French restaurants, it was, for those who could
                            afford it, an extremely agreeable and cosmopolitan milieu. Although no
                            one was more aware of the repressive terror that undergirded the city
                            darkly, the poet <name type="pname">Alexander Pushkin</name> (<date

                            delighted voice to its violent gaiety, its regimented design, and its
                            military spectacle in <hi rend="italic">The Bronze Horseman</hi>.</p>
                        <p>The masters of the modern socialist state who succeeded the czars who
                            built <name type="place">St. Petersburg</name> found its grand design
                            congenial. The heroic scale of <name type="place">St.
                            Petersburg</name>'s streets and squares, the regimentation of its
                            architecture, the iconography of power conveyed by its public
                            sculpture&#x2014;all these brilliantly served as the model that <name
                                type="place">Russia</name>'s twentieth-century Communist rulers
                            appropriated in the planning of <name type="place">Moscow</name> and
                            other cities where they wished to proclaim both doctrinaire political
                            authority and a conservative modernity.</p>
                        <p>By contrast, monumental planning in a symbolic sense held small appeal to
                            the shapers of a democratic country whose fundamental goal was the
                            pursuit of immediate wealth through free enterprise. The opportunities
                            inherent in a seemingly limitless supply of land and the hardships
                            attendant upon occupying it were such that practicality, not pomp, was
                            the order of the day in colonial <name type="place">America</name>. Only
                            when freedom from British rule was achieved did the founders of the new
                            United States, supported in their aesthetic ideals by the presence in
                            their country of French allies following the war for independence,
                            commission an architect from <name type="place">France</name>, Pierre
                            L'Enfant, to prepare a plan for its new capital of <name type="place"
                                >Washington, D.C.</name> (see fig. 6.54). As we shall see, this
                            initial exercise in American urban grandeur was confined to this one
                            city and was only fully realized in the twentieth century. For the most
                            part the serviceable grid employed by Spanish colonial settlers proved
                            of equal merit to the British, whose cities became the models for the
                            western expansion of the United States of <name type="place"

                    <p>The European arrival in <name type="place">America</name> had profound
                        consequences for landscape design. Sixteenth- and seventeenth-century
                        explorers and colonists, whose motives were primarily economic, sought
                        wealth in the form of ore, minerals, timber, and other natural resources. In
                        appropriating a new continent, they had scant regard for the customs, ritual
                        centers, and attitudes toward nature of the native occupants, the traces of
                        whose presence within the landscape were by and large effaced. Spanish,
                        Dutch, French, and English traders and settlers came, some to build towns
                        and farm the land, others to convert souls, trap animals, or mine gold and
                        silver. Although all of these European cultures left their mark, the two
                        principal ones to imprint the American landscape in design terms were the
                        Spanish and the English.</p>

                        <p>The first European power to establish settlements in the Americas, <name
                                type="place">Spain</name> began its colonizing activities
                            immediately following <name type="pname">Christopher Columbus</name>'s
                            momentous discovery. At first, when it was still believed that
                            Columbus's landfall had occurred in the Indies, government-sponsored
                            expeditions were motivated purely by the desire for trade and the
                            appropriation of riches. But the dimensions and natural resources of a
                            vast continent gradually revealed themselves. By <date when="1550"
                                >1550</date>, Spanish explorers had ventured from Cuba north to the
                            peninsula they named <name type="place">La Florida</name>, continuing
                            west as far as present-day <name type="place">Arkansas</name> and north
                            along the eastern seaboard of what is now the United States. At the same
                            time, adventurers departing from <name type="place">Mexico City</name>
                            traveled overland into the arid lands that became <name type="place"
                                >Texas</name>, <name type="place">New Mexico</name>, and <name
                                type="place">Arizona</name> and by sea up the Pacific coast to the
                            more verdant region that is now <name type="place">California</name> and
                                <name type="place">Oregon</name>. Tales of mythical cities and
                            magical places like the Fountain of Youth and Diamond Mountain were
                            discredited one by one, and by the first decade of the sixteenth
                            century, it was clear that if wealth was to be gained, <name
                                type="place">Spain</name> would have to subjugate this vast
                            territory and build an empire based not on fabulous finds, but rather on
                            the hard work of farming, ranching, and mining. Laying claim to the
                            entire North American continent, <name type="place">Spain</name> began
                            its colonization efforts.</p>
                        <p>The Spanish strategy of conquest was based upon three distinct types of
                            settlement: the mission; the military <hi rend="italic">presidio</hi>,
                            or fort; and the civilian <hi rend="italic">pueblo or villa</hi>, as
                            towns were variously called depending upon their size and importance.
                            The missionary spearheaded the campaign to convert native peoples to
                            Catholicism and Spanish cultural mores. The soldier manned the <hi
                                rend="italic">presidio</hi> and served as the initial secular
                            intermediary with native peoples, protecting the mission and settlement
                            from hostile invasion while establishing contacts with friendly tribes.
                            The colonist came in their wake, building the <hi rend="italic"
                                >pueblo</hi>, establishing civil law, and developing the regional
                            economy.</p>
                        <p>The Spanish government issued explicit instructions for the layout of
                            these new towns, at first on a case-by-case basis. As settlements
                            multiplied, however, colonial administrators found it necessary to
                            codify their planning prescriptions in a royal ordinance called the <hi
                                rend="italic">Recopilaci&#x00F3;n de Leyes de los Reynos de las
                                Indias</hi>, or the <hi rend="italic">Laws of the Indies</hi>, which
                                <name type="pname">Philip II</name> promulgated in <date when="1573"
                                >1573</date>. Pragmatic in its objectives and designed to create a
                            simple paradigm that could be easily followed by architecturally
                            inexperienced men in remote lands, the <hi rend="italic">Laws of the
                                Indies</hi> ignored the innovative urban schemes of contemporary
                            late Renaissance planners, opting instead for the ancient Roman formula
                            for military encampments and new towns as set forth by <name
                                type="pname">Vitruvius</name> around 30 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                                >b.c.e.</hi> and summarized by <name type="pname">Alberti</name> in
                            his fifteenth-century treatise <hi rend="italic">De re
                                aedificatoria</hi>. In this way, the orthogonal streets and central
                            forum of the ancient colonial city became the plaza-centered grid
                            settlement of <name type="place">Spanish America</name>.<ref
                                target="#CH6-n15"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold"

                        <p>After the colonists had selected an appropriately healthful site and
                            performed the required rituals&#x2014;usually the saying of
                            mass&#x2014;they marked off a rectangular area for the town and built
                            the protective <hi rend="italic">presidio</hi>. Their next task was to
                            construct a water supply and irrigation system and to lay out and allot
                            fields outside the town. Then they began filling in its outlines, first
                            reserving a central space for a plaza of rectangular proportions, its
                            recommended length, according to the <hi rend="italic">Laws</hi>, being
                            at least one and a half times its width inasmuch as "this proportion is
                            the best for festivals in which horses are used." Whereas, as discussed
                            in Chapter One, the plazas of the Native American pueblos were
                            cosmologically aligned according to religious custom with each side
                            facing one of the cardinal directions, Spanish colonial plazas had each
                            corner pointing in a cardinal direction because the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Laws</hi> proclaimed that this prevented undue exposure "to the
                            four principal winds." Four main thoroughfares ran from the middle of
                            each side of the plaza across the length and breadth of the town, and
                            the borders of the plaza were defined by secondary streets. The <hi
                                rend="italic">Laws</hi> directed that other streets be laid out
                            "consecutively around the plaza." This injunction almost invariably
                            resulted in a checkerboard or grid pattern. This grid layout was useful
                            for parceling real estate among the settlers of the <hi rend="italic"
                                >pueblo</hi>. At the same time, it<pb n="222"/><pb n="222"
                                type="orig"/>asserted symbolically the authority of the crown over
                            both the settlers and the native population.</p>
                        <p>Building lots around the plaza were reserved for administrative and other
                            public purposes as well as for shops and dwellings for merchants. The
                            remaining lots in this location were to be distributed by lottery, and
                            the crown held those not distributed for future allocation. It was
                            recommended that the main church be freestanding, sited in an elevated
                            location, and furnished with its own adjacent plaza. The <hi
                                rend="italic">Laws</hi> further enjoined those responsible for
                            laying out the town to reserve outside the palisade a common large
                            enough so that if the town grew "there would always be sufficient space
                            for its inhabitants to find recreation and for cattle to pasture without
                            encroaching upon private property."</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">Laws</hi> instructed town planners to give the
                            plaza and the four main streets diverging from it arcades "for these are
                            a great convenience for those who resort thither for trade." In <name
                                type="place">Santa Fe</name>, <name type="place">New Mexico</name>,
                            and in other Spanish colonial settlements one may still find sidewalks
                            around the plaza sheltered by <hi rend="italic">portales</hi>, or
                            porticoes, more rustic in character but nevertheless derived from those
                            found along the principal thoroughfares of ancient Roman and Renaissance
                            cities (see fig. 6.40). These <hi rend="italic">portales</hi> sometimes
                            extended along the four principal streets as well as along the eight
                            streets running from the corners of the plaza. If the town planners
                            followed the injunction set forth in the colonial ordinance, the <hi
                                rend="italic">portales</hi> at the corner streets would not obstruct
                            the street crossing, being arranged so that "the sidewalks of the street
                            can evenly join those of the plaza." Particularly after native uprisings
                            made their overseers wary, settlers were directed to fortify the houses
                            around the plaza.</p>
                        <p>In practice, there were deviations from the rules for town planning set
                            forth in <hi rend="italic">Laws of the Indies</hi>, but their intentions
                            were honored widely throughout <name type="place">Spain</name>'s two
                            hundred years of North American colonization. The Spanish "old towns" of
                            several contemporary cities reflect this heritage, later emphasized by
                            the neo-Spanish-Colonial architecture of many buildings in southern
                                <name type="place">California</name> and throughout the American
                            Southwest. Thus we find at the beginning of the eighteenth century, when
                            new forms of planning inspired by French practice and Italian precedents
                            were changing the appearance of European cities, that such <hi

                            scale inasmuch as lands granted by crown charter were distributed to
                            colonists in the form of nucleated farming communities resembling

                            reasons as well as for security and adherence to tradition, most early
                                <name type="place">New England</name> settlers lived in
                            distinctively defined communities, even as some were dispersing because

                            Rivers. Branching off at intervals on either side of this spine, short
                            streets lead to one or the other river. Along its north side lies the
                            town common, now lined with handsome brick houses.</p>
                        <p><name type="place">New Haven</name> was settled in <date when="1638"
                                >1638</date> as a nine-square grid&#x2014;that is, a square composed
                            of nine blocks, each measuring 825 feet (251.5 meters)
                            square&#x2014;fitted between two streams entering a harbor on the north
                            shore of Long Island Sound (fig. 6.46). The central square, reserved as
                            a green to be held in common, thus constitutes one-ninth of the town, an
                            unusual amount of public space for that period, even in <name
                                type="place">New England</name> where commons were an important
                            feature of town planning. The meetinghouse, the central institution of
                            the religiously ruled <name type="place">New England</name> community,
                            was always given pride of place in any planning scheme, being located
                            atop a prominent topographical elevation or, in the case of <name
                                type="place">New Haven</name> and many other towns, adjacent to, or
                            within, the central common. Outside the town boundaries lay the fields,
                            which were typically laid out as long narrow strips of land and parceled
                            to proprietors by lottery or some other equitable means. In this
                            suburban zone were additional common lands reserved as cattle pastures
                            and timber lands. As <name type="place">New Haven</name>'s population
                            expanded, its green was bisected, with three churches occupying one
                            half, while the other half remained as open public space. In addition,
                            each of its eight remaining blocks was subdivided into four smaller
                            blocks as townsmen surrendered for houses the areas reserved for garden
                            plots. Houses also lined the radial thoroughfares leading from the
                            boundaries of the nine-square grid to the waterfront and to the fields,
                            for at its inception <name type="place">New Haven</name> had attracted
                            more settlers from <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> than the
                            originally planned number of 250. The town's importance increased when,
                            in <date when="1717">1717</date>, the newly founded Yale College was
                            moved from Saybrook to one of the blocks adjacent to the green.</p>
                        <p>The foresight demonstrated in <name type="place">New Haven</name>'s
                            planning and that of other <name type="place">New England</name> towns
                            does not entirely account for their scenic character. The combination of
                            site and architecture, the latter a product of several generations of
                            thoughtfully erected buildings using a limited range of visually
                            pleasing materials, produced the townscape that is admired today
                            wherever it has not been sacrificed to meet the needs of the automobile.
                            The ordered serenity of these towns, which are often nestled in the
                            folds of the glaciated <name type="place">New England</name> landscape
                            with its naturally picturesque ponds and hills, provides modern
                            vacationers with a glimpse of an earlier <name type="place"
                                >America</name> that is still capable of stirring emotions both
                            patriotic and nostalgic. Save for a few well-tended historic sites,
                            there is little evidence of the rude and cramped houses of the first
                            settlers. Instead, especially in towns where historic preservation is
                            fueled by sufficient affluence, one finds a harmony of later
                            architectural styles. The Neoclassicism favored by the builders of the
                            young republic is seen in columned porticoes and broad pediments, while
                            nearby the turreted solidity of neo-Romanesque rusticated stone betokens
                            the prosperity of the victorious Union after the Civil War when
                            manufacturing wealth made possible the further architectural adornment
                            of this part of the country. But sadly missing are most of the elms
                            that, before the twentieth-century blight of Dutch elm disease, lifted
                            their graceful canopies over village greens, college campuses, and
                            roadways.</p>

                        <p>This generally satisfying townscape is the result of a consensual
                            attitude on the part of the inhabitants regarding those elements that
                            collectively portray community. Perhaps more than elsewhere in the
                            United States, one apprehends in the physiognomy of the <name

                            values. Not surprisingly, the nineteenth-century French student of
                            democracy Alexis de Tocqueville, in tracing the modern origins of this
                            experiment in human governance, emphasized the formative influ<pb

                            expression of a democratic social structure was a basic Puritan one that
                            had envisioned a controlled hierarchical ordering of the town.<ref

                                the Indies</hi>, this paradigm did have an ex post facto
                            codification in an anonymous and less detailed document entitled "The
                            Ordering of Towns." It presupposed townships 6 square miles (9.7 square
                            kilometers) in area, which were to be arranged in six concentric zones
                            around a central meetinghouse, with outlying lands held as commons in
                            the manner of English villages before the enclosure movement. The
                            allotment was to be in accordance with "the condition of mankind," or
                            according to social and economic status, with the fifth ring of
                            settlement having the largest and most desirable parcels consisting of
                            30 to 40 acres of arable land, woodlot, and meadow.</p>
                        <p>In spite of the lament of <name type="pname">Governor Bradford</name> and
                            sermons by divines such as Cotton Mather castigating land-hungry
                            "outlivers," those who settled more than half a mile distant from the
                            meetinghouse, this strongly nucleated ideal was destined to be modified
                            as the first settlers began to produce surplus livestock for sale to
                            newcomers and the need for additional lands grew apace. More and more
                            outlying land became owner-occupied as the commodities it produced
                            engendered trade, and convenience and security dictated that
                            entrepreneurial settlers take up residence on their properties. Thus,
                            from the beginning, commercial forces vied with those that promoted
                            compact community settlement. The spatial configuration of the <name
                                type="place">New England</name> town was therefore the result of the
                            modification of sectarian attitudes and the adaptation of the agrarian
                            mores brought from <name type="place">Old England</name> to a new

                            approached the task of colonization as an administrator and businessman.
                            He developed a land distribution program that granted city lots on a
                            basis proportionate to the size of a purchaser's overall land holdings.
                            He sent three commissioners with the first group of settlers, enjoining
                            them to select a healthy and navigable site for the city, which they had
                            located by the summer of <date when="1682">1682</date> on land midway
                            between the Delaware and Schuylkill Rivers.</p>
                        <p>The plan <name type="pname">Penn</name> envisioned for his city was one
                            in which uniform streets were to stretch from the country bounds to the
                            water's edge. With <name type="place">London</name>'s Great Fire of
                                <date when="1666">1666</date> still fresh in his memory, he wrote,
                            "Let every house be placed, if the person pleases, in the middle of its
                            plat, as to the breadth of it, that so there may be ground on each side
                            for gardens or orchards, or fields, that it may be a green country town,
                            which will never be burnt, and always be wholesome."<ref

                            In this fashion did <name type="pname">Penn</name> enunciate the ideal
                            that homeowning Americans have embraced over the course of three hundred
                            years&#x2014;a freestanding house surrounded by its own plot of land. To
                            assist in the task of laying out the new city, he appointed <name
                                type="pname">Captain Thomas Holme</name> as surveyor general.</p>
                        <p>With <name type="pname">Penn</name>'s arrival in <date when="1682-10"
                                >October 1682</date>, the plan for the city began to take shape
                            under his personal direction. He had Holme draw a gridiron bounded on
                            the east by the Delaware and on the west by the Schuylkill, with a
                            central square at the crossing of its two principal axes, Broad Street
                            and High Street (fig. 6.47). Familiar with <name type="pname"
                                >Lincoln</name>'s Inn Fields and Moorfields&#x2014;open spaces
                            accessible to the general public in <name type="place"
                            >London</name>&#x2014;the city's recently developed private residential
                            squares, and probably at least one of the several post-Great Fire plans
                            calling for urban green space, he directed Holme to place a square
                            within each quadrant of the city. <name type="pname">Penn</name> was
                            explicit that they be open to all members of the community, unlike the
                            new <name type="place">London</name> squares, which were reserved for
                            the exclusive use of neighboring property owners.</p>
                        <p>The public square, along with the freestanding home with its adjacent
                            garden, was <name type="pname">Penn</name>'s important contribution to
                            the future American cityscape, for the<pb n="225"/><pb n="225"

                            green spaces, became the model that settlers applied almost ubiquitously
                            to new communities as they moved westward. Sometimes occupied by
                            courthouses or other public buildings, such squares everywhere denote
                            civic intention and community focus.</p>
                        <p>As in <name type="place">New Haven</name>, <name type="pname"
                            >Penn</name>'s generously scaled blocks became subdivided as row houses
                            were built along narrow streets inserted where gardens had been
                            intended. This happened also in other cities as population growth
                            accelerated and speculation in urban land increased. Where land
                            speculators platted grids designed to realize a maximum profit from lot
                            sales, the squares of <name type="pname">Penn</name>'s "green country
                            town" were often eliminated or reduced to a single token public space.
                            There existed, however, another important example of American colonial
                            planning in which a gracious and livable city&#x2014;Savannah, <name
                                type="place">Georgia</name>&#x2014;was built and maintained over a
                            long period of time according to the intentions of its founder.</p>

                            Parliament who was interested in prison reform, secured a charter from
                                <name type="pname">King George II</name> for the founding of the
                            colony of <name type="place">Georgia</name>. Here he hoped, with a
                            subscription of funds raised from a group of humane aristocrats, to
                            transport incarcerated debtors who wished to seek a fresh start in life
                            as well as persons experiencing religious persecution and others eager
                            for economic opportunity. The following year found him working
                            indefatigably alongside the 114 original colonists, supervising the
                            clearing of a large rectangular area of the tall pine forest where his
                            town was to be laid out along a crescent bend in the Savannah River 10
                            miles (16.1 kilometers) inland from the sea. A palisade was soon erected
                            and the first houses built even as the terms of property deeds were
                            being defined. These deeds demonstrate the regional scope of <name
                                type="pname">Oglethorpe</name>'s plan, which granted each settler a
                            house lot measuring 60 by 90 feet (18.3 by 27.4 meters), a 5-acre garden
                            plot, and a 44-acre farm, with the stipulation that he must construct a
                            house within an eighteen-month period and cultivate at least 10 acres of
                            his outlying farmland.</p>
                        <p>Like <name type="pname">Penn</name>, <name type="pname">Oglethorpe</name>
                            was familiar with the pattern of residential development in <name
                                type="place">London</name> whereby groups of houses were being built
                            speculatively around green squares, a process that the prosperity of
                                <name type="place">Georgian England</name> had accelerated. He was
                            probably also familiar with the plans for <name type="place"
                                >Philadelphia</name> and <name type="place">New Haven</name>. But
                            the original and ingenious feature of his plan for Savannah was the
                            concept of the ward as a group of forty house lots laid out as four
                            tithings," or blocks of ten houses each, with the blocks ranged beside a
                            central green, next to two sides of which two large lots were reserved
                            for churches and other public and semipublic buildings such as stores.
                            Savannah therefore was not to be laid out, like <name type="place"
                                >Philadelphia</name> or <name type="place">New Haven</name>, as an
                            urban grid with one or more spaces exempted from development; rather the
                            grid was to be formed additively by ward units, each with a green square
                            in the center. This meant that, as the city grew, it could never become
                            a solid urban mass because it would always have an open green square
                            within each new ward (figs. 6.48, 6.49).</p>

                        <p>When Spotswood came to occupy this mansion in <date when="1710"
                                >1710</date>, he continued the axis of the palace green in the
                            gardens he laid out behind it and encouraged as the mark of genteel
                            civilization the planting of orchards and gardens here and at the
                            college (fig. 6.50). An intelligent site planner, Spotswood also helped
                            place several buildings in the new town in relationship to open spaces
                            and view lines. Unfortunately, he abused an informal understanding he
                            had with another prominent colonist, <name type="pname">John
                                Custis</name> (<date when="1678">1678</date>&#x2013;<date
                                when="1749">1749</date>), when he cut down several more trees than
                            anticipated on the latter's property in order to open up a "visto,"
                            probably that along the palace green. He also aroused the ire of the
                            House of Burgesses when he transformed the ravine behind the Governor's
                            Palace into a series of elaborate terraces and built a rectangular canal
                            connected to a fish pond and a large park. The legislators balked at the
                            earth-moving and excavation costs incurred in building "the Fish-Pond
                            and Falling gardens," putting to an end Spotwood's landscaping efforts
                            at <name type="place">Williamsburg</name>, but not before he had set the
                            tone for its future development.</p>
                        <p>In the affluent western half of the town, colonists laid out utilitarian
                            gardens that were, nevertheless, modeled on those of the Governor's
                            Palace, their straight gravel paths flanked by topiary after the fashion
                            established a few years earlier in the royal gardens of <name
                                type="pname">William</name> and <name type="pname">Mary</name> and
                            those of the country estates designed during their English reign (see
                            figs. 6.10&#x2013;6.12). In his garden Custis displayed some of the
                            botanical specimens that were then arousing scientific curiosity as a
                            lively transatlantic seed exchange began to occur. Nearby plantation
                            owners, notably <name type="pname">William Byrd</name> and his son,
                                <name type="pname">William Byrd II</name>, both members of <name

                            recruiting such naturalists as <name type="pname">William

                            activities also promoted the use of native plants in town gardens. The
                            Byrds' Westover plantation served as a laboratory for botanical
                            experiments in which Banister, who also had his own botanical garden,
                            assisted until his untimely death on a collecting expedition with the
                            elder Byrd.</p>

                        <p>By the middle of the eighteenth century, <name type="place"
                                >Williamsburg</name>, like <name type="pname">Charleston</name>, had
                            become an important center for the transmission of botanical knowledge
                            among plantation owners, town gardeners, and interested parties back
                            home in <name type="place">England</name>. Many of <name type="place"
                                >Williamsburg</name>'s gardens were reconstructed by the Rockefeller
                            Foundation beginning in <date when="1926">1926</date> (see Chapter
                            Fifteen). The landscape architect in charge, <name type="pname">Arthur

                            prevailing at the time of the town's foundation, studying existing <name

                            He subsequently created geometric <hi rend="italic">parterres</hi> and
                            topiary as well as a holly maze in the same configuration as the one of
                            yew at Hampton Court.</p>
                        <p>The most splendid gardens of the colonial period were those belonging to
                            wealthy southern plantation owners who enjoyed the benefits of a mild
                            climate and were able to employ a large workforce of slaves in garden
                            construction. In the eighteenth century, as <name type="place"
                                >Virginia</name> and the Carolinas became the locus of much
                            botanical activity, these southern gardens displayed many plants new to
                            horticulture.</p>
                        <p>Along the James River in <name type="place">Virginia</name>, tobacco
                            generated the wealth that enabled great estate holders to landscape
                            their properties with graceful terraces leading to river landings, the
                            usual means of approach to a plantation mansion, although they also
                            dignified their inland entrance drives by planting long <hi

                            was ambitiously landscaped in this fashion. Near Charleston, <name
                                type="place">South Carolina</name>, where rice and indigo were the
                            basis of a prosperous colonial economy, the terraced slopes of the
                            gardens above the Ashley and Cooper Rivers were called falls. Many of
                            the once-great gardens that lined the banks of these two rivers
                            succumbed to the American Revolution and the Civil War as well as to
                            natural disasters and the misfortunes of time. There remains, however,
                            one excellent representative example, Middleton Place, which is open to
                            the public. Descendants of the original owner, <name type="pname">Henry
                                Middleton</name>, have restored the gardens their ancestor laid out
                            in <date when="1741">1741</date> beside the Ashley River (figs. 6.51,
                            6.52).</p>
                        <p>Although it is an eighteenth-century garden, Middleton Place does not
                            stand within the tradition of contemporary English landscape design, but
                            rather harks back to the earlier style of <name type="pname"
                                >William</name> and <name type="pname">Mary</name> exemplified at
                                <name type="place">Williamsburg</name>. From the Charleston Road on
                            the inland side a long drive becomes a sweeping oval turnaround,
                            carrying the visitor past the stables to the point where the main house
                            once stood. This principal axis continues opposite the house site,
                            becoming the spine of the gardens' most original feature, the falls, a
                            series of five gracefully bowed grassy terraces, the curves of which are
                            echoed in the pair of lakes that form the shape of a butterfly where the
                            garden meets the plantation's low-lying rice fields and the causeway
                            leading to the river landing.</p>

                            upon revenues derived from agriculture and livestock. His home at Mount
                            Vernon, high above the Potomac, was one of five farms he worked on the
                            banks of the river. As a son of the Enlightenment, he followed with keen
                            interest not only those developments in botanical science that were of
                            benefit to agronomy but also the exciting discoveries that were
                            enriching the palette of ornamental horticulture. Although he lacked

                            contemporary English and French landscape design, he owned engravings by

                            their ends in order to mediate the visual transition between their lines
                            and those of the serpentine walks. In addition to planting thickly the
                            space in between the garden walls and the bowling green, he constructed
                            two earthen mounds next to the entrance drive, setting weeping willows
                            beside them while leaving open a view of the distant woods.</p>
                        <p>Two groves of trees flanked the house on the east, and here he turned the
                            sloping grounds into a deer park and planted low-growing shrubs so as
                            not to interrupt the vista framed by his classical portico of rising
                            hills ranging into the blue distance. A ha-ha, or continuous ditch,
                            served as an invisible fence, thus preventing deer from grazing adjacent
                            to the house. In keeping with contemporary practice for rural burial

                                >1825</date>) to prepare a plan for it (fig. 6.54). L'Enfant, a

                                >America</name> as a volunteer in the cause of the Revolution, had

                            stayed on to find work in the new United States. It was a time when
                            other young French professionals, deprived of their former <hi

                            eastern seaboard cities in this country Upon hearing of the decision to
                            establish a new capital, L'Enfant, who was designing and remodeling
                            mansions in <name type="place">New York City</name>, wrote to <name
                                type="pname">Washington</name> offering to draw up a plan for the

                                >Washington</name>, whether he realized this irony or not, was, in
                            effect, importing a planning vision expressive of autocratic monarchy as
                            the paradigm for a new kind of national grandeur based upon the
                            principles of revolution and the Enlightenment.</p>
                        <p>L'Enfant had, in fact, spent eight of his boyhood years at <name
                                type="place">Versailles</name> where his father, Pierre L'Enfant,
                            was employed in decorating the building of the Ministry of War. He had
                            subsequently enrolled in the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture in
                                <name type="place">Paris</name> and was therefore aware of all the
                            developments, both royal and private, to embellish that capital. His
                            first assignment from <name type="pname">Washington</name> was to assess
                            the topographic qualities of the site, and in accordance with the theory
                            of <name type="pname">Dezallier d'Argenville</name>, the plan that he
                            proposed did not imply the arbitrary imposition of a preconceived scheme
                            upon nature, but rather used existing landforms as the basis of design.

                            instead of <name type="pname">Jefferson</name>'s uniform grid,
                            L'Enfant's was overlaid with another diagram consisting of squares and

                            of L'Enfant's boyhood town of <name type="place">Versailles</name>, a
                            grid punctuated with squares and set within a framework of superimposed
                            diagonal axes.</p>
                        <p>Although the urban scale fostered by an ambitious monarch at <name
                                type="place">Versailles</name> was expansive, that of <name
                                type="place">Washington, D.C.</name>, was more so. The new capital
                            city set at the edge of a vast continent was proportioned to reflect the
                            the opportunity of abundant untenanted land as well as the ambitions of
                            its founders. The major avenues were 160 feet (49 meters) wide, with 80
                            feet (24 meters) reserved for the roadbed and 30 feet (9 meters) for
                            flanking walkways. These walkways were defined by double rows of trees,
                            and there was an additional 10-foot strip separating the trees from the
                            adjacent building lots on either side.</p>
                        <p>These great tree-lined avenues were named for the then-existing states
                            and grouped roughly according to their geography with the northeastern
                            states in the northern part of the district, the mid-Atlantic states in
                            the center and the southern states in the southeastern section. <name

                            democratic society. L'Enfant's plan also included Judiciary Square, the
                            site chosen for the Supreme Court, and fifteen other squares. These were

                            the hope that their citizens would appropriate, through private
                            subscription, funds for their improvement.</p>
                        <p>In brief, given the equivalent of a blank slate upon which to work,
                            L'Enfant transcended the conjoined garden-town model of his native <name
                                type="place">Versailles</name>, creating in <name type="place"
                                >Washington, D.C.</name>, a city with many gardens within it. This
                            combination of green openness and urban monumentality constitutes the
                            American capital's uniqueness.</p>
                        <p>It is clear from the foregoing that cities were developing in a manner
                            that made them physically and conceptually different from their
                            predecessors. They were expanding and becoming ungirdled, their walls
                            torn down, a physical metaphor perhaps for the way in which philosophers
                            were embracing open-ended scientific inquiry. Furthermore, in the
                            eighteenth century, their cultural contents were enlarged as new
                            institutions were incorporated into the urban fabric. Formerly the
                            province of princes or private universities, botanical and zoological
                            gardens, libraries, museums, theaters, and opera houses were now
                            considered the rightful legacy of the urban bourgeoisie. A fundamental
                            result of the American and French Revolutions was the creation of a
                            sense of popular entitlement. By the nineteenth century, cultural
                            institutions were considered an essential part of the public domain. One
                            institution, the public park, became an especially important element in
                            the altered social structure of cities. From its inception, one American
                            city, <name type="place">Washington, D.C.</name>, contained many
                            parklike elements; in building Central Park a little over a half century
                            later <name type="place">New York City</name> spearheaded a movement for
                            the creation of public parks throughout the nation, in which the notion
                            of <hi rend="italic">rus en urbe</hi>, an artful fusion of country and
                            city, was promoted as an essential moral and public health benefit.</p>
                        <p>In summary, the urban fabric was becoming more loosely woven and of more
                            generous dimensions. As cities grew, tore down their walls, and blurred
                            the line between urban and rural, the human attitude toward nature was
                            significantly transformed. The spreading city gradually engulfed the
                            rural countryside, and nature became an increasingly important component
                            within the urban framework. The creation of naturalistic parks, however,
                            did not occur without a cultural shift. That change was becoming
                            apparent in the relaxation of French landscape design norms at the end
                            of the seventeenth century. But to grasp the character of this change
                            more fully, we must turn to eighteenth-century <name type="place"
